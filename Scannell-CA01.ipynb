I should like to congratulate Joseph Garba of Nigeria, a distinguished diplomat, on his election as President of this session of the General Assembly, and I wish him success in his presidency.\\nI feel a great personal pleasure on this occasion, for this is a homecoming for both Barbara and me. The memories of my time here in 1971 and 1972 are still with me today - the human moments, the humorous moments that are part of even the highest undertaking.\\nWith the Assembly's permission, I should like to share one story from one of the many meetings of the Security Council. I was the Permanent Representative of the United States, and I was 45 minutes late for the meeting. All 45 minutes were filled by the first speaker to take the floor, and when I walked in and took my seat the speaker paused, with great courtesy, and said: 'I welcome the Permanent Representative of the United States. And now, for his benefit, I will start my speech all over again, from the beginning.'\\nThat is a true story, at that moment. differences of alliance and ideology didn't matter. The universal groan that went up around that table from every representative present, and the laughter that followed united us all. Today, I would like to begin by recognising - again, a personal privilege - the current Permanent Representatives with whom I served, Ambassador Dugersuren, Ambassador Martinez Ordonez. Ambassador Pabetafika and Permanent Observer Dube. It is wonderful to look around and see so any familiar faces - foreign ministers, members of the Secretariat, and delegates. Of course, the Secretary-General, you were the Permanent representative of your country when we served together. Under-Secretary-General Farah. you were a Permanent Representative back then too. Ambassador Aguilar was here then and is now back. It is an honour to be back with you in this historic Hall, and I apologize if , have forgotten any of you old enough to have served in 1971 and 1972.\\n\\nThe United Nations was established forty-four years ago upon the ashes of war and amidst great hopes. The UN can do great things. No, the United Nations is not perfect, it is not a panacea for the world's problem. But it is a vital forum where the nations of the world seek to replace conflict with consensus, and it must remain a forum for peace. The UN has the support of the United States of America. In recent years, the war of words that is often echoed in this Hall has been giving way to a new mood. \\nWe have seen a welcome shift from polemics to peace-keeping. United Nations Peace-keepers have given their lives in service to the United Nations. Today, should like to remember one of those soldiers of peace, an American on a mission of peace under the United Nations flag, on a mission for all the world, a man of unquestioned bravery and unswerving, dedication to the United Nations ideal - Lieutenant-Colonel William Richard Higgins. I call on the General Assembly to condemn the murder of this soldier of peace and to call on those responsible to have the decency to return his remains to his family. Let us all - right now, right here - dedicate ourselves and our nations to the cause that Colonel Higgins served so selflessly.\\nThe founders of this historic institution believed that it was here that the nations of the world might come to agree that law, not force, shall govern. And the United Nations can play a fundamental role in the central issue of our time, for today, there is an idea at work around the globe, an idea of undeniable force - and that idea is freedom. Freedom's advance is evident everywhere.- Central Europe and Hungary, where State and society are now in the midst of a movement towards political pluralism and a free-market economy, where the barrier that once enforced an unnatural division between Hungary and its neighbours to the west has been torn down and replaced by a new hope for the future, a new hope in freedom. We see freedom at work in Poland, where, in deference to the will of the people, the Communist Party has relinquished its monopoly on power, and indeed in the Soviet Union, where the world hears the voices of people no longer afraid to speak out or to assert the right to rule themselves.\\nBut freedom's march is not confined to a single continent or to the developed world alone. We see the rise of freedom in Latin America where, one by one, dictatorships are giving way to democracy. We see it on the continent of Africa, where more and more nations see in the system of free enterprise salvation for economies crippled by excessive State control. East and West, North and South, on every continent, we can see the outlines of a new world of freedom.\\nOf course, freedom's work remains unfinished. The trend we see is not yet universal. Some regimes still stand against the tide. Some rulers still deny the right of the people to govern themselves. But now the power of prejudice and despotism is challenged. Never before have these regimes stood so isolated and alone, so out of step with the steady advance of freedom. Today we are witnessing an ideological collapse, the demise of the totalitarian idea of the omniscient, all-powerful State. There are many reasons for this collapse, but in the end one fact alone explains what we see today: advocates of the totalitarian idea saw its triumph written in the laws of history, they failed to see the love of freedom that was written in the human heart.\\nTwo hundred years ago today, the United States - our Congress - proposed the Bill of Rights: fundamental freedoms belonging to every individual. Rights no Government can deny. Those same rights have been recognized in this congress of nations in the words of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations. From where we stand, on the threshold of this new world of freedom, the trend is clear enough. If, for those who write the history of our times, the twentieth century is remembered as the century of the state, the twenty-first century must be an era of emancipation, the age of the individual. Make no mistake, nothing can stand in the way of freedom's march. There will come a day when freedom is seen the world over to be the universal birthright of every man and woman, of every race and walk of life. Even under the worst circumstances, at the darkest of times, freedom has always remained alive - a distant dream, perhaps, but always alive.\\nToday, that dream is no longer distant. For the first time, for millions around the world, a new world of freedom is within reach. Today is freedom's moment. You see, the possibility now exists for the creation of a true community of nations, built on shared interests and ideals. A true community, a world where free Governments and free markets meet the rising desire of the people to control their own destiny, to live in dignity, and to exercise freely their fundamental human rights. It is time that worked together to deliver that destiny into the hands of men and women everywhere. Our challenge is to strengthen the foundations of freedom, encourage its advance and face our most urgent challenges, the global challenges of the twenty-first century: economic, health, environmental well-being, the great questions of war and peace.\\nFirst, global economic growth. During this decade, a number of developing nations have moved into the ranks of the world's most advanced economies, all of them - each and every one - powered by the engine of free enterprise. In the decade ahead, others can join their ranks, but for many nations, barriers stand in the way. In the case of some countries, these are obstacles of their own making: un-needed restrictions, regulations that act as dead weights on their own economies and obstacles to foreign trade. But other barriers to growth exist, and those, too, require effective action.\\nToo many developing countries struggle today under a burden of debt that makes growth all but impossible. The nations of the world deserve better opportunity to achieve a measure of control over their own economic fate and build better lives for their own people. The approach the United States has put forward - the Brady plan - will help these nations reduce that debt and, at the same time, encourage the free market reforms that will fuel economic growth.\\nIn just two days, I will be speaking to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and I will discuss there, in more detail, the steps that our nations can take in dealing with the debt problem. But I can say now the new world of freedom is not a world where a few nations live in comfort while others live in want. The power of commerce is a force for progress. Open markets are the key to continued growth in the developing world. Today, the United States buys over one-half of the global manufactured exports that all developing nations combined sell to the industrialized world. It is time for the other advanced economies to follow suit, to create expanded opportunities for trade. I believe we will learn, in the century ahead, that many nations of the world have barely begun to tap their true potential for development. The free market and its fruits are not the special preserve of a few, they are a harvest that everyone can share.\\nBeyond the challenge of global growth lies another issue of global magnitude: the environment. No line drawn on a map can stop the advance of pollution. Threats to our environment have become international problems. We must develop an international approach to urgent environmental issues, one that seeks common solutions to common problems. The United Nations is already at work on the question of global warming and the effort to prevent oil spills and other disasters from fouling our seas and the air we breathe. And I will tell you now the United States will do its part. We have committed ourselves to the world-wide phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons by the year 2000. We have proposed amending our own Clean Air Act to ensure clean air for our citizens within a single generation. We have banned the import of ivory to protect the elephant and rhinoceros from the human predators who exterminate them for profit. And we have begun to explore ways to work with other nations, with the major industrialized democracies, and in Poland and in Hungary, to make common cause for the sake of our environment.\\nThe environment belongs to all of us. In this new world of freedom, the world's citizens must enjoy this common trust for generations to come. Global economic growth and the stewardship of our planet - both are critical issues.\\nBut as always, questions of war and peace must be paramount to the United Nations. We must move forward to limit and eliminate weapons of mass destruction. Five years ago, at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, I presented a United States draft treaty outlawing chemical weapons. Since then, progress has been made, but time is running out. The threat is growing. More than 20 nations now possess chemical weapons or the capability to produce them. And these horrible weapons are now finding their way into regional conflicts. That is simply unacceptable. For the sake of mankind, we must halt and reverse this threat.\\nToday I want to announce steps that the United States is ready to take, steps to rid the world of these truly terrible weapons, steps towards a treaty that will ban - eliminate - all chemical weapons from the Earth 10 years from the day it is signed. This initiative contains three major elements. First, in the first eight years of a chemical weapons treaty the United States is ready to destroy nearly all - 98 per cent - of our chemical weapons stockpile, provided the Soviet Union joins the ban, and I think it will. Secondly, we are ready to destroy all of our chemical weapons - 100 per cent, every one - within 10 years, once all nations capable of building chemical weapons sign that total-ban treaty. And thirdly, the United States is ready to begin now. We will eliminate more than 80 per cent of our stockpile even as we work to complete a treaty, if the Soviet Union joins us in cutting chemical weapons to an equal level and if we agree on the conditions, including inspections, under which stockpiles are destroyed.\\nWe know that monitoring a total ban on chemical weapons will be a challenge. But the knowledge we have gained from our recent arms control experience and our accelerating research in this area makes me believe that we can achieve the level of verification that gives us confidence to go forward with the ban. The world has lived too long in the shadow of chemical warfare? so let us act together, beginning today, to rid the Earth of this scourge.\\nWe are serious about achieving conventional arms reductions as well. And that is why we put forward new proposals just last Thursday at the negotiations in Vienna on conventional forces in Europe, proposals that demonstrate our commitment to act rapidly to ease military tensions in Europe and move the nations of that continent one step closer to their common destiny: a Europe whole and free.\\nThe United States is convinced that open and innovative measures can move disarmament forward and also ease international tensions. That is the idea behind the 'open skies' proposal, about which the Soviets have now expressed a positive attitude. It is the idea behind the 'open lands' proposal, permitting for the first time ever free travel for all Soviet and United States diplomats throughout each other's countries. Openness is the enemy of mistrust, and every step towards a more open world is a step towards the new world we seek.\\nLet me make this comment on our meetings with the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, Mr. Shevardnadze, over the past few days: I am very pleased by the progress made. The Soviet Union removed a number of obstacles to progress on conventional and strategic arms reductions. We reached agreements in principle on issues from verification to nuclear testing. And, of course, we agreed to a summit in the spring or early summer of 1990. I look forward to meeting Mr. Gorbachev there.\\nEach of those achievements is important in its own right, but they are more important still as signs of a new attitude that prevails between the United States and the USSR. Serious differences remain; we know that. But the willingness to deal constructively and candidly with those differences is news that we and indeed the world must welcome. We have not entered into an era of perpetual peace. The threats to peace that nations face may today be changing, but they have not vanished. In fact, in a number of regions around the world, a dangerous combination is now emerging: regimes armed with old and unappeasable animosities and modern weapons of mass destruction. That development will raise the stakes whenever war breaks out. Regional conflict may well threaten world peace as never before.\\nThe challenge of preserving peace is a personal one for all individuals right here in this Hall. Mr. Secretary-General, I say with great respect that you have made it your own. The United Nations can be a mediator, a forum where parties in conflict come in search of peaceful solutions. For the sake of peace, the United Nations must redouble its support for the peace efforts now under way in regions of conflict all over the world. I assure the Assembly that the United States is determined to take an active role in settling regional conflicts. Sometimes our role in regional disputes is and will be highly public, and sometimes, like many others do, we work quietly behind the scenes. But always, we are working for positive change and lasting peace.\\nOur world faces other, less conventional threats no less dangerous to international peace and stability. Illegal drugs are a menace to social order and a source of human misery wherever they gain a foothold. The nations which suffer this scourge must join forces in the fight, and we are. Let me salute the commitment and extraordinary courage of one country in particular: Colombia, where\\nwe are working with the people and their President, Virgil lo Barco, to put the drug cartels cut of business and bring the drug lords to justice.\\nFinally, we must join forces to combat the threat of terrorism. Every nation and the United Nations must send the outlaws of the world a clear message hostage-taking and the terror of random violence are methods that cannot win the world's approval. Terrorism of any kind is repugnant to all values that a civilized world holds in common. And make no mistake.- Terrorism is a means that no end, no matter how just, can sanctify.\\nWhatever the challenge, freedom greatly raises the chances of our success. Freedom's moment is a time for hope for all of the world, because freedom, once set in motion, takes on a momentum of its own. As I said the day I assumed the presidency of our country, we do not have to talk late into the night about which form of government is better. We know that free government, democracy, is best. And I believe that is the hard-won truth of our time, the unassailable fact that still stands at the end of a century of great struggle and human suffering. And this is true not because all our differences must give way to democracy , but because democracy makes room for all our differences. In democracy, diversity finds its common home.\\nAt the very heart of the democratic ideal is respect for freedom of belief, freedom of thought and action, in all its diversity, for human rights. The world has experienced enough of the ideologies that have promised to remake man in some new and better image. We have seen the colossal tragedies and dashed hopes. We know now that freedom and democracy hold the answers: what men and nations want is the freedom to live by their own lights and a chance to prosper, in peace.\\nWhen I began today I spoke to you about peace-keeping. I want to speak to you now about peace-making. We must bring peace to the people who have never known its blessings. There is a painting that hangs on the wall of my office in the White House which pictures President Abraham Lincoln and his generals meeting near the end of a war that remains the bloodiest in the history of my country. Outside at that moment a battle rages, in this picture, and yet what we see in the distance is a rainbow, a symbol of hope, of the passing of the storm. That painting is called 'The Peace-makers'. For me, it is a constant reminder that our struggle, the struggle for peace, is a struggle blessed by hope.\\nI do remember sitting in this Hall, I remember the mutual respect among all of us proudly serving as representatives, yes, I remember the almost endless speeches - and I do not want this to be one of them - the Security Council sessions, the receptions, those long receiving lines, the formal meetings of the General Assembly, and the informal discussions in the delegates' lounge. And I remember something more, something beyond the frantic pace and sometimes frustrating experiences of daily life here: The heartbeat of the United Nations, the quiet conviction that we could make the world more peaceful, more free. What we sought then, all of us, now lies within our reach. I ask each of you here in this Hall:\\nCan we not bring a unity of purpose to the United Nations? Can we not make this new world of freedom the common destiny we seek? I believe we can. I know we must. My solemn wish today is that here, among the United Nations, that spirit will take hold, and that all men and all nations will make freedom's moment their own.\\nThank you, God bless you, and may God bless the work of the United Nations.  \\n</td>\n","      <td>19779</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3038</th>\n","      <td>46</td>\n","      <td>1991</td>\n","      <td>USA</td>\n","      <td>United States</td>\n","      <td>George Bush</td>\n","      <td>President</td>\n","      <td>﻿I am honoured to speak with you as you open the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I should first like to congratulate the outgoing President, Guido de Marco of Malta, and salute our incoming President, Samir Al-Shihabi of Saudi Arabia.\\nI also want to salute especially Secretary-General Javier Peres de Cuellar, who will step down in just over three months. But let me say, Secretary-General Peres de Cuellar has served with great distinction during a period of unprecedented change and turmoil, and for almost 10 years we have enjoyed the leadership of this man of peace, a man that I, along with many Members, feel proud to call friend, and so today let us congratulate our friend and praise his spectacular service to the United Nations and to the people of the world, the Secretary-General.\\nLet me also welcome new Members in this Hall, two delegations representing Korea, particularly our democratic friends, the Republic of Korea, the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and new missions from the Marshall Islands and Micronesia. Twenty years ago, when I was the Permanent Representative here for the United States, there were 132 United Nations Members. Just one week ago, 159 nations enjoyed membership in the United Nations, and today the number stands at 166. The presence of these new Members alone provides reason for us to celebrate. \\nMy statement today will not sound like any you have heard from a President of the United States. I am not going to dwell on the super-Power competition that defined international politics for half a century. Instead, I will discuss the challenges of building peace and prosperity in a world leavened by the cold war's end and the resumption of history.\\nCommunism held history captive for years. It suspended ancient disputes; and it suppressed ethnic rivalries, nationalist aspirations and old prejudices. As it has dissolved, suspended hatreds have sprung to life. People who for years have been denied their pasts, have begun searching for their own identities, often through peaceful and constructive means, occasionally through factionalism and bloodshed.\\nThis revival of history ushers in a new era teeming with opportunities and perils. Let us begin by discussing the opportunities. First, history's renewal enables people to pursue their natural instincts for enterprise. Communism froze that progress until its failures became too much for even its defenders to bear, and now citizens throughout the world have chosen enterprise over envy, personal responsibility over the enticements of the State, prosperity over the poverty of central planning.\\nThe United Nations Charter encourages this adventure by pledging to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples, and I can think of no better way to fulfil this Mission than to promote the free flow of goods and Ideas, frankly, ideas and goods will travel around the globe with or without our help. The information revolution has destroyed the weapons of enforced isolation and ignorance. In many parts of the world technology has overwhelmed tyranny, proving that the age of Information can become the age of liberation, if we limit State power wisely and free our people to make the best use of new ideas, inventions and insights. By the same token, the world has learned that free markets provide levels of prosperity, growth and happiness that centrally planned economies can never offer.\\nEven the most charitable estimates indicate that in recent years the free world's economies have grown at twice the rate of the former communist world. Growth does more than fill shelves; it permits every person to gain, not at the expense of others but to the benefit of others. Prosperity encourages people to live as neighbours, not as predators. Economic growth can aid international relations in exactly the same way.\\nMany nations represented here are parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The Uruguay Round, the latest in the post-war series of trade negotiations, offers hope to developing nations, many of which have been cruelly divided, cruelly deceived, by the false promises of totalitarianism. Here in this Hall, we hear about North-South problems. But free and open trade, including unfettered access to markets and credit, offers developing countries means of self-sufficiency and economic dignity.\\nIf the Uruguay Round should fail, a new wave of protectionism could destroy our hopes for a better future. History shows all too clearly that protectionism can destroy wealth within countries and poison relations between them. Therefore, I call upon all members of GATT to redouble their efforts to reach a successful conclusion for the Uruguay Round. I pledge that the United States will do its part.\\nI cannot stress this enough: Economic progress will play a vital role In the new world. It supplies the soil in which democracy grows best. People everywhere seek government of and by the people, and they want to enjoy their inalienable rights to freedom and property and person. Challenges to democracy have failed. Just last month, coup plotters in the Soviet Union tried to derail the forces of liberty and reform, but Soviet citizens refused to follow. Most of the nations in this Hall stood with the forces of reform led by Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, and against the coup plotters.\\nThe challenge facing the Soviet peoples now, that of building political systems based upon individual liberty, minority rights, democracy and free markets, mirrors every nation's responsibility for encouraging peaceful, democratic reform, but it also testifies to the extraordinary power of the democratic ideal. As democracy flourishes, so does the opportunity (or a third historical breakthrough, international cooperation. A year ago, the Soviet Union joined the United States and a host of other nations in defending a tiny country against aggression and opposing Saddam Hussein. For the very first time on a matter of major importance super-Power competition was replaced with international cooperation. The United Nations, in one of its finest moments, constructed a measured, principled, deliberate and courageous response to Saddam Hussein. It stood up to an outlaw who invaded Kuwait, who threatened many States within the region, who sought to set a menacing precedent for the post-cold-war world.\\nThe coalition effort established a model for the collective settlement of disputes. Members sat the goal - the liberation of Kuwait - and devised a courageous, unified means of achieving that goal. Mow, for the first time, we have a real chance to fulfil the United Nations Charter's ambition of working 'to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war ... to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small ... to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom'. Those are the words of the Charter.\\nHe will not revive these ideals if we fail to acknowledge the challenge that the renewal of history presents. In Europe and Asia, nationalist passions have flared anew, challenging borders, straining the fabric of international society. At the same time, around the world many age-old conflicts still fester. We see signs of this tumult right here. The United Nations has mounted more peace-keeping missions in the last 36 months than during its first 43 years, and although we now seem mercifully liberated from the fear of nuclear holocaust, these smaller, virulent conflicts should trouble us all.\\nWe must face this challenge squarely - first, by pursuing the peaceful resolution of disputes now in progress; secondly, and more importantly, by trying to prevent others from erupting. No one hare can promise that today's borders will remain fixed for all time, but we must strive to ensure the peaceful, negotiated settlement of border disputes.\\nWe must also promote the cause of international harmony by addressing old feuds. We should take seriously the Charter's pledge to practise tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours. United Nations General Assembly resolution 3379 (XXX), the so-called 'Zionism is racism' resolution, mocks this pledge and the principles upon which the United Nations was founded, and I call now for its repeal. Zionism is not a policy; it is the idea that led to the creation of a home for the Jewish people, to the State of Israel, and to equate Zionism with the intolerable sin of racism is to twist history and forget the terrible plight of Jews in the Second World War - and indeed throughout history. To equate Zionism with racism is to reject Israel itself, a Member in good standing of the United Nations. This body cannot claim to seek peace and at the same time challenge Israel's right to exist. By repealing this resolution unconditionally the United Nations will enhance its credibility and serve the cause of peace.\\nAs we work to meet the challenge posed by the resumption of history, we also must defend the Charter's emphasis on inalienable human rights. Government has failed if citizens cannot speak their mind, if they cannot form political parties freely and elect governments without coercion, it they cannot practice their religion freely, if they cannot raise their families in peace, if they cannot enjoy a just return from their labour, if they cannot live fruitful lives and at the end of their days look upon their achievements and their society's, progress with pride. Politicians who talk about democracy and freedom but provide neither eventually will feel the sting of public disapproval and the power of peoples yearning to live free.\\nSome nations still deny their basic rights to the people, and too many voices cry out for freedom. For example, the people of Cuba suffer oppression at the hands of a dictator who has not got the word, the lone hold-out in an otherwise democratic hemisphere, a man who has not adapted to a world that has no use for totalitarian tyranny. Elsewhere, despots ignore the heartening fact that the rest of the world is embarked upon a new age of liberty.\\nThe renewal of history also imposes an obligation to remain vigilant about new threats and old. He must expand our efforts to control nuclear proliferation. We must work to prevent the spread of chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them.\\nIt is for this reason that I put forward my Middle East arms initiative, a comprehensive approach to stop and, where possible, reverse the accumulation of arms in that part of the world moat prone to violence. We must remember that self-interest will tug nations in different directions, and that struggles over perceived interests will flare sometimes into violence. We can never say with confidence where the next conflict may arise. And we cannot promise eternal peace - not while demagogue peddle false promises to people hungry with hope; not while terrorists use our citizens as pawns and drug dealers destroy our peoples. He, as a result, must band together to overwhelm affronts to basic human dignity. It is no longer acceptable to shrug and say that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. Let us put the law above the crude and cowardly practice of hostage-holding.\\nIn a world defined by change, we must be as firm in principle as we are flexible in our response to changing international conditions. That is especially true today of Iraq. Six months after the adoption of Security Council resolutions 687 (1991) and 688 (1991), Saddam continues to rebuild his weapons of mass destruction and to subject the Iraqi people to brutal repression. Saddam's contempt for United Nations resolutions was first demonstrated back in August 1990, and it continues even as I am speaking. His Government refuses to permit unconditional helicopter inspections, and right now is refusing to allow United Nations inspectors to leave inspected premises with documents relating to an Iraqi nuclear weapons programme. It is the view of the United States that we must keep the United Nations sanctions in place as long as he remains in power. This also shows that we cannot compromise for a moment in seeing that Iraq destroys all of its weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. And we will not compromise.\\nThis is not to say - let me be clear on this point - that we should punish the Iraqi people. Let me repeat: our argument has never been with the people of Iraq. It was, and is, with a brutal dictator whose arrogance dishonours the Iraqi people. Security Council resolution 706 (1991) created a responsible mechanism for sending humanitarian relief to innocent Iraqi citizens. He must put that mechanism to work. Ma must not abandon our principled stand against Saddam's aggression. This cooperative effort has liberated Kuwait. Now it can lead to a just government in Iraq. And when it does - when it does - the Iraqi people can look forward to better lives, free at home, free to engage in a world beyond their borders.\\nThe resumption of history also permits the United Nations to resume the important business of promoting the values that I have discussed today. This body can serve as a vehicle through which willing parties can settle old disputes. In the months to come, I look forward to working with Secretary-General Peres de Cuellar and his successor as we pursue peace in such diverse and divided lands as Afghanistan, Cambodia, Cyprus, El Salvador, and Western Sahara. The United Nations can encourage free market development through its international lending and aid institutions. However, it should not dictate the particular forms of government that nations should adopt. It can, and should, encourage the values upon which the Organization was founded. Together, we should insist that nations seeking our acceptance meet standards of human decency.\\nWhere institutions of freedom have lain dormant, the United Nations can offer them new life. These institutions play a crucial role in our quest for a new world order, an order in which no nation must surrender one iota of its own sovereignty, an order characterized by the rule of law rather than the resort to force, the cooperative development of disputes rather than anarchy and bloodshed, and an unstinting belief in human rights.\\nFinally, you may wonder about America's role the new world I have described. Let me assure you, the United States has no intention of striving for a pax americana. However, we will remain engaged. We will not retreat and pull back into isolationism. We will offer friendship and leadership. In short, we seek a pax universalis, built upon shared responsibilities and aspirations.\\nTo all assembled: We have an opportunity to spare our sons and daughters the sins and errors of the past. We can build a future more satisfying than any our world has ever known. The future lies undefined before us, full of promise, littered with peril. We can choose the kind of world we want: one blistered by the fires of war and subjected to the winds of coercion and chance, or one made more peaceful by reflection and choice. Take this challenge seriously. Inspire future generations to praise and venerate you, to say, 'On the ruins of conflict, these brave men and women built an era of peace and understanding. They inaugurated a new world order, an order worth preserving for the ages.'\\nGood luck to each and every one of you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n","      <td>15555</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4814</th>\n","      <td>56</td>\n","      <td>2001</td>\n","      <td>USA</td>\n","      <td>United States</td>\n","      <td>George W.

Every civilized nation here today is resolved\\nto keep the most basic commitment of civilization. We\\nwill defend ourselves and our future against terror and\\nlawless violence.\\nThe United Nations was founded in this cause. In\\nthe Second World War, we learned that there is no\\nisolation from evil. We affirmed that some crimes are\\nso terrible they offend humanity itself, and we resolved\\nthat the aggressions and ambitions of the wicked must\\nbe opposed early, decisively and collectively, before\\nthey threaten us all.\\nThat evil has returned, and that cause is renewed.\\nA few miles from here, many thousands still lie in a\\ntomb of rubble. Tomorrow, the Secretary-General, the\\nPresident of the General Assembly and I will visit that\\nsite, where the names of every nation and region that\\nlost citizens will be read aloud. If we were to read out\\nthe names of every person who died, it would take\\nmore than three hours.\\nThose names include a citizen of the Gambia,\\nwhose wife spent their fourth wedding anniversary, 12\\nSeptember, searching in vain for her husband. Those\\nnames include a man who supported his wife in\\nMexico, sending home money every week. Those\\nnames include a young Pakistani who prayed towards\\nMecca five times a day and who died that day trying to\\nsave others.\\nThe suffering of 11 September was inflicted on\\npeople of many faiths and many nations. All of the\\nvictims, including Muslims, were killed with equal\\nindifference and equal satisfaction by the terrorist\\nleaders.\\nThe terrorists are violating the tenets of every\\nreligion, including the one they invoke. Last week, the\\nsheikh of Al-Azhar University, the world’s oldest\\nIslamic institution of higher learning, declared that\\nterrorism is a disease and that Islam prohibits killing\\ninnocent civilians. The terrorists call their cause holy,\\nyet they fund it with drug dealing. They encourage\\nmurder and suicide in the name of a great faith that\\nforbids both. They dare to ask God’s blessing as they\\nset out to kill innocent men, women and children. But\\n8\\n\\nthe God of Isaac and Ishmael would never answer such\\na prayer. And a murderer is not a martyr; he is just a\\nmurderer.\\nTime is passing. Yet for the United States of\\nAmerica, there will be no forgetting 11 September. We\\nwill remember every rescuer who died in honour. We\\nwill remember every family that lives in grief. We will\\nremember the fire and ash, the last phone calls, the\\nfunerals of the children.\\nAnd the people of my country will remember\\nthose who have plotted against us. We are learning\\ntheir names. We are coming to know their faces. There\\nis no corner of the Earth distant or dark enough to\\nprotect them. However long it takes, their hour of\\njustice will come.\\nEvery nation has a stake in this cause. As we\\nmeet, the terrorists are planning more murder —\\nperhaps in my country, or perhaps, fellow members, in\\nyours. They kill because they aspire to dominate. They\\nseek to overthrow Governments and to destabilize\\nentire regions. Last week, anticipating this meeting of\\nthe General Assembly, they denounced the United\\nNations; they called our Secretary-General a criminal\\nand they condemned all Arab nations here as traitors to\\nIslam. Few countries meet their exacting standards of\\nbrutality and oppression. Every other country is a\\npotential target.\\nAnd all the world faces the most horrifying\\nprospect of all: those same terrorists are searching for\\nweapons of mass destruction, the tools to turn their\\nhatred into holocaust. They can be expected to use\\nchemical, biological and nuclear weapons the moment\\nthey are capable of doing so. No hint of conscience\\nwould prevent it. That threat cannot be ignored; that\\nthreat cannot be appeased. Civilization itself — the\\ncivilization we share — is threatened. History will\\nrecord our response and will judge or justify every\\nnation in this Hall.\\nThe civilized world is now responding. We act to\\ndefend ourselves and to deliver our children from a\\nfuture of fear. We choose the dignity of life over a\\nculture of death. We choose lawful change and civil\\ndisagreement over coercion, subversion and chaos.\\nThose commitments — hope and order, law and life —\\nunite people across cultures and continents. Upon those\\ncommitments depend all peace and progress. For those\\ncommitments, we are determined to fight.\\nThe United Nations has risen to this\\nresponsibility: on 12 September, these buildings\\nopened for emergency meetings of the General\\nAssembly and of the Security Council. Before the sun\\nhad set, these attacks on the world stood condemned by\\nthe world, and I want to thank you, fellow members,\\nfor that strong and principled stand.\\nI also thank the Arab and Islamic countries that\\nhave condemned terrorist murder. Many of you have\\nseen the destruction of terror in your own lands. The\\nterrorists are increasingly isolated by their own hatred\\nand extremism. They cannot hide behind Islam. The\\nauthors of mass murder and their allies have no place\\nin any culture, and no home in any faith.\\nThe conspiracies of terror are being answered by\\nan expanding global coalition. Not every nation will be\\npart of every action against the enemy. But every\\nnation in our coalition has duties. Those duties can be\\ndemanding, as we in America are learning. We have\\nalready made adjustments in our laws and in our daily\\nlives. We are taking new measures to investigate terror\\nand to protect against threats.\\nThe leaders of all nations must now carefully\\nconsider their responsibilities and their future. Terrorist\\ngroups such as Al Qaeda depend upon the aid or\\nindifference of Governments. They need the support of\\na financial infrastructure and safe havens to train and\\nplan and hide.\\nSome nations want to play their part in the fight\\nagainst terror but tell us they lack the means to enforce\\ntheir laws and control their borders. We stand ready to\\nhelp.\\nSome Governments still turn a blind eye to the\\nterrorists, hoping the threat will pass them by. They are\\nmistaken.\\nAnd some Governments, while pledging to\\nuphold the principles of the United Nations, have cast\\ntheir lot with the terrorists. They support them and\\nharbour them. And they will find that their welcomed\\nguests are parasites that will weaken them and\\neventually consume them. For every regime that\\nsponsors terror there is a price to be paid, and it will be\\npaid. The allies of terror are equally guilty of murder\\nand equally accountable to justice.\\nThe Taliban are now learning that lesson. That\\nregime and the terrorists who support it are now\\nvirtually indistinguishable. Together they promote\\n9\\n\\nterror abroad and impose a reign of terror on the\\nAfghan people. Women are executed in Kabul’s soccer\\nstadium. They can be beaten for wearing socks that are\\ntoo thin. Men are jailed for missing prayer meetings.\\nThe United States, supported by many nations, is\\nbringing justice to the terrorists in Afghanistan. We are\\nmaking progress against military targets — and that is\\nour objective. Unlike the enemy, we seek to minimize,\\nnot maximize, the loss of innocent life. I am proud of\\nthe honourable conduct of the American military. And\\nmy country grieves for all the suffering the Taliban\\nhave brought upon Afghanistan, including the terrible\\nburden of war.\\nThe Afghan people do not deserve their present\\nrulers. Years of Taliban misrule have brought nothing\\nbut misery and starvation. Even before this current\\ncrisis, 4 million Afghans depended on food from the\\nUnited States and other nations, and millions of\\nAfghans were refugees from Taliban oppression.\\nI make this promise to all the victims of that\\nregime: the Taliban’s days of harbouring terrorists, and\\ndealing in heroin, and brutalizing women are drawing\\nto a close. When that regime is gone, the people of\\nAfghanistan will say, with the rest of the world, good\\nriddance.\\nI can promise, too, that America will join the\\nworld in helping the people of Afghanistan rebuild\\ntheir country.\\nMany nations, including mine, are sending food\\nand medicine to help Afghans through the winter.\\nAmerica has airdropped over 1.3 million packages of\\nrations in Afghanistan. Just this week, we airlifted\\n20,000 blankets and over 200 tons of provisions into\\nthe region. We continue to provide humanitarian aid,\\neven while the Taliban try to steal the food we send.\\nMore help, eventually, will be needed. The\\nUnited States will work closely with the United\\nNations and development banks to reconstruct\\nAfghanistan after hostilities there have ceased and the\\nTaliban are no longer in control. And the United States\\nwill work with the United Nations to support a post-\\nTaliban Government that represents all of the Afghan\\npeople.\\nIn this war of terror, each of us must answer for\\nwhat we have done or what we have left undone. After\\ntragedy, there is a time for sympathy and condolence.\\nMy country has been very grateful for both.\\nThe memorials and vigils around the world will\\nnot be forgotten. But the time for sympathy has now\\npassed. The time for action has now arrived.\\nThe most basic obligations in this new conflict\\nhave already been defined by the United Nations. On\\n28 September, the Security Council adopted resolution\\n1373 (2001). Its requirements are clear: every\\nUnited Nations Member has a responsibility to crack\\ndown on terrorist financing. We must pass all necessary\\nlaws in our own countries to allow the confiscation of\\nterrorist assets. We must apply those laws to every\\nfinancial institution in every nation.\\nWe have a responsibility to share intelligence and\\ncoordinate the efforts of law enforcement. If you know\\nsomething, tell us. If we know something, we will tell\\nyou. And when we find the terrorists, we must work\\ntogether to bring them to justice.\\nWe have a responsibility to deny any sanctuary,\\nsafe haven, or transit to terrorists. Every known\\nterrorist camp must be shut down, its operators\\napprehended, and evidence of their arrest presented to\\nthe United Nations.\\nWe have a responsibility to deny weapons to\\nterrorists — and to actively prevent private citizens\\nfrom providing them.\\nThese obligations are urgent, and they are binding\\non every nation with a place in this Hall. Many\\nGovernments are taking these obligations seriously,\\nand my country appreciates it. Yet even beyond\\nresolution 1373 (2001), more is required — and more\\nis expected — of our coalition against terror. We are\\nasking for a comprehensive commitment to this fight.\\nWe must unite in opposing all terrorists, not just\\nsome of them. In this world, there are good causes and\\nbad causes, and we may disagree on where that line is\\ndrawn. Yet there is no such thing as a good terrorist.\\nNo national aspiration, no remembered wrong, can ever\\njustify the deliberate murder of the innocent. Any\\nGovernment that rejects this principle — trying to pick\\nand choose its terrorist friends — will know the\\nconsequences.\\nWe must speak the truth about terror. Let us never\\ntolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the\\nattacks of 11 September — malicious lies that attempt\\nto shift the blame away from the terrorists themselves,\\naway from the guilty. To inflame ethnic hatred is to\\nadvance the cause of terror.\\n10\\n\\nThe war against terror must not serve as an\\nexcuse to persecute ethnic and religious minorities in\\nany country. Innocent people must be allowed to live\\ntheir own lives, by their own customs, under their own\\nreligion. And every nation must have avenues for the\\npeaceful expression of opinion and dissent. When these\\navenues are closed, the temptation to speak through\\nviolence grows.\\nWe must press on with our agenda for peace and\\nprosperity in every land. My country is pledged to\\nencouraging development and expanding trade. My\\ncountry is pledged to investing in education and\\ncombating AIDS and other infectious diseases around\\nthe world. Following 11 September, these pledges are\\neven more important. In our struggle against hateful\\ngroups that exploit poverty and despair, we must offer\\nan alternative of opportunity and hope.\\nThe American Government also stands by its\\ncommitment to a just peace in the Middle East. We are\\nworking towards a day when two States — Israel and\\nPalestine — live peacefully together, within secure and\\nrecognized borders, as called for by the Security\\nCouncil resolutions. We will do all in our power to\\nbring both parties back into negotiations. But peace\\nwill come only when all have sworn off — forever —\\nincitement, violence and terror.\\nFinally, this struggle is a defining moment for the\\nUnited Nations itself — and the world needs its\\nprincipled leadership. It undermines the credibility of\\nthis great institution, for example, when the\\nCommission on Human Rights offers seats to some of\\nthe world’s most persistent violators of human rights.\\nThe United Nations depends, above all, on its moral\\nauthority — and that authority must be preserved.\\nThe steps I have described will not be easy. For\\nall nations, they will require effort. For some nations,\\nthey will require great courage. Yet the cost of inaction\\nis far greater. The only alternative to victory is a\\nnightmare world where every city is a potential killing\\nfield.\\nAs I told the American people, freedom and fear\\nare at war. We face enemies that hate not our policies,\\nbut our existence — the tolerance of openness and the\\ncreative culture that define us. But the outcome of this\\nconflict is certain.\\nThere is a current in history, and it runs towards\\nfreedom. Our enemies resent it and dismiss it, but the\\ndreams of mankind are defined by liberty — the natural\\nright to create, and build, and worship, and live in\\ndignity. When men and women are released from\\noppression and isolation, they find fulfilment and hope,\\nand they leave poverty by the millions. These\\naspirations are lifting up the peoples of Europe, Asia,\\nAfrica and the Americas, and they can lift up all of the\\nIslamic world. We stand for the permanent hopes of\\nhumanity, and those hopes will not be denied.\\nWe are confident, too, that history has an author,\\nwho fills time and eternity with his purpose. We know\\nthat evil is real, but good will prevail against it. This is\\nthe teaching of many faiths. And in that assurance, we\\ngain strength for a long journey.\\nIt is our task — the task of this generation — to\\nprovide the response to aggression and terror. We have\\nno other choice, because there is no other peace. We\\ndid not ask for this mission, yet there is honour in\\nhistory’s call. We have a chance to write the story of\\nour times — a story of courage defeating cruelty, and\\nlight overcoming darkness. This calling is worthy of\\nany life, and worthy of every nation. So let us go\\nforward — confident, determined and unafraid.\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n","      <td>14724</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5002</th>\n","      <td>57</td>\n","      <td>2002</td>\n","      <td>USA</td>\n","      <td>United States</td>\n","      <td>Mr. George W.

We have much yet to do — in\\nAfghanistan and beyond. Many nations represented\\nhere have joined in the fight against global terror, and\\nthe people of the United States are grateful.\\nThe United Nations was born in the hope that\\nsurvived a world war — the hope of a world moving\\ntowards justice, escaping old patterns of conflict and\\nfear. The founding Members resolved that the peace of\\nthe world must never again be destroyed by the will\\nand the wickedness of any man. We created the United\\nNations Security Council so that, unlike the League of\\nNations, our deliberations would be more than talk, our\\nresolutions would be more than wishes. After\\ngenerations of deceitful dictators, broken treaties and\\nsquandered lives, we dedicated ourselves to standards\\nof human dignity, shared by all, and to a system of\\nsecurity defended by all.\\nToday, these standards, and this security, are\\nchallenged.\\nOur commitment to human dignity is challenged\\nby persistent poverty and raging disease. The suffering\\nis great, and our responsibilities are clear. The United\\nStates is joining with the world to supply aid where it\\nreaches people and lifts up lives, to extend trade and\\nthe prosperity it brings, and to bring medical care\\nwhere it is desperately needed.\\nAs a symbol of our commitment to human\\ndignity, the United States will return to the United\\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\\nOrganization (UNESCO). This organization has been\\nreformed, and America will participate fully in its\\nmission to advance human rights, tolerance and\\nlearning.\\nOur common security is challenged by regional\\nconflicts — ethnic and religious strife that is ancient,\\nbut not inevitable. In the Middle East, there can be no\\npeace for either side without freedom for both sides.\\nAmerica stands committed to an independent and\\ndemocratic Palestine, living side by side with Israel in\\npeace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians\\ndeserve a government that serves their interests and\\nlistens to their voices. My nation will continue to\\nencourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities\\nas we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the\\nconflict.\\nAbove all, our principles and our security are\\nchallenged today by outlaw groups and regimes that\\naccept no law of morality and have no limit to their\\nviolent ambitions. In the attacks on America a year\\nago, we saw the destructive intentions of our enemies.\\nThis threat hides within many nations, including my\\nown. In cells and camps, terrorists are plotting further\\ndestruction and are building new bases for their war\\nagainst civilization. And our greatest fear is that\\nterrorists will find a shortcut to their mad ambitions\\nwhen an outlaw regime supplies them with the\\ntechnologies enabling them to kill on a massive scale.\\nIn one place, in one regime, we find all these\\ndangers, in their most lethal and aggressive forms —\\nexactly the kind of aggressive threat the United Nations\\nwas born to confront. Twelve years ago, Iraq invaded\\nKuwait without provocation. And the regime's forces\\nwere poised to continue their march to seize other\\ncountries and their resources. Had Saddam Hussein\\nbeen appeased instead of stopped, he would have\\nendangered the peace and stability of the world. Yet,\\nthis aggression was stopped by the might of coalition\\nforces and the will of the United Nations.\\nIn order to suspend hostilities and to spare\\nhimself, Iraq's dictator accepted a series of\\ncommitments. The terms were clear to him, and to all.\\nAnd he agreed to prove that he is complying with every\\none of those obligations. He has proven instead only\\nhis contempt for the United Nations and for all his\\npledges. By breaking every pledge, by his deceptions\\nand by his cruelties, Saddam Hussein has made the\\ncase against himself.\\nIn 1991, Security Council resolution 688 (1991)\\ndemanded that the Iraqi regime cease at once the\\nrepression of its own people, including the systematic\\nrepression of minorities, which the Council said,\\n“threaten[ed] international peace and security in the\\nregion”.\\nThis demand goes ignored. Last year, the United\\nNations Commission on Human Rights found that Iraq\\ncontinues to commit extremely grave violations of\\nhuman rights and that the regime's repression is all\\npervasive. Tens of thousands of political opponents and\\n7\\n\\nordinary citizens have been subjected to arbitrary arrest\\nand imprisonment, summary execution, and torture by\\nbeating, burning, electric shock, starvation, mutilation\\nand rape. Wives are tortured in front of their husbands;\\nchildren in the presence of their parents; and all of\\nthese horrors are concealed from the world by the\\napparatus of a totalitarian State.\\nIn 1991, the United Nations Security Council,\\nthrough its resolutions 686 (1991) and 687 (1991),\\ndemanded that Iraq return all prisoners from Kuwait\\nand other lands. Iraq's regime agreed. It broke this\\npromise. Last year the Secretary-General's high-level\\ncoordinator for this issue reported that Kuwaiti, Saudi,\\nIndian, Syrian, Lebanese, Iranian, Egyptian, Bahraini,\\nand Omani nationals remain unaccounted for — more\\nthan 600 people. One American pilot is among them.\\nIn 1991, the United Nations Security Council,\\nthrough resolution 687 (1991), demanded that Iraq\\nrenounce all involvement with terrorism and permit no\\nterrorist organizations to operate in Iraq. Iraq's regime\\nagreed. It broke this promise. In violation of Security\\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001), Iraq continues to\\nshelter and support terrorist organizations that direct\\nviolence against Iran, Israel, and Western\\nGovernments. Iraqi dissidents abroad are targeted for\\nmurder. In 1993, Iraq attempted to assassinate the Emir\\nof Kuwait and a former American President. Iraq's\\nGovernment openly praised the attacks of 11\\nSeptember. Al-Qaida terrorists have escaped from\\nAfghanistan and are known to be in Iraq.\\nIn 1991, the Iraqi regime agreed to destroy and to\\nstop developing all weapons of mass destruction and\\nlong-range missiles, and to prove to the world it has\\ndone so by complying with rigorous inspections. Iraq\\nhas broken every aspect of this fundamental pledge.\\nFrom 1991 to 1995, the Iraqi regime said it had\\nno biological weapons. After a senior official in its\\nweapons program defected and exposed this lie, the\\nregime admitted to producing tens of thousands of\\nlitres of anthrax and other deadly biological agents for\\nuse in Scud missile warheads, aerial bombs and aircraft\\nspray tanks. United Nations inspectors believe Iraq has\\nproduced two to four times the amount of biological\\nagents it declared and has failed to account for more\\nthan three metric tons of material that could be used to\\nproduce biological weapons. Right now, Iraq is\\nexpanding and improving facilities that were used for\\nthe production of biological weapons.\\nUnited Nations inspections also reveal that Iraq\\nlikely maintains stockpiles of VX, mustard and other\\nchemical agents, and that the regime is rebuilding and\\nexpanding facilities capable of producing chemical\\nweapons.\\nAnd in 1995, after four years of deception, Iraq\\nfinally admitted that it had had a crash nuclear\\nweapons programme prior to the Gulf war. We know\\nnow that, were it not for that war, the regime in Iraq\\nwould likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later\\nthan 1993.\\nToday, Iraq continues to withhold important\\ninformation about its nuclear programme: weapons\\ndesign, procurement logs, experiment data, an\\naccounting of nuclear materials and documentation of\\nforeign assistance. Iraq employs capable nuclear\\nscientists and technicians. It retains physical\\ninfrastructure needed to build a nuclear weapon. Iraq\\nhas made several attempts to buy high-strength\\naluminium tubes used to enrich uranium for a nuclear\\nweapon. Should Iraq acquire fissile material, it would\\nbe able to build a nuclear weapon within a year. And\\nIraq's State-controlled media have reported numerous\\nmeetings between Saddam Hussein and his nuclear\\nscientists, leaving little doubt about his continued\\nappetite for these weapons.\\nIraq also possesses a force of Scud-type missiles\\nwith ranges beyond the 150 kilometres permitted by the\\nUnited Nations. Work at testing and production\\nfacilities shows that Iraq is building more long-range\\nmissiles that can inflict mass death throughout the\\nregion.\\nIn 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the\\nworld imposed economic sanctions on Iraq. Those\\nsanctions were maintained after the war to compel the\\nregime's compliance with Security Council resolutions.\\nIn time, Iraq was allowed to use oil revenues to buy\\nfood. Saddam Hussein has subverted that programme,\\nworking around the sanctions to buy missile\\ntechnology and military materials. He blames the\\nsuffering of Iraq's people on the United Nations, even\\nas he uses his oil wealth to build lavish palaces for\\nhimself and to buy arms for his country. By refusing to\\ncomply with his own agreements, he bears full guilt for\\nthe hunger and misery of innocent Iraqi citizens.\\nIn 1991, Iraq promised United Nations inspectors\\nimmediate and unrestricted access to verify Iraq's\\ncommitment to rid itself of weapons of mass\\n8\\n\\ndestruction and long-range missiles. Iraq broke that\\npromise, spending seven years deceiving, evading and\\nharassing United Nations inspectors before ceasing\\ncooperation entirely. Just months after the 1991\\nceasefire, the Security Council twice renewed its\\ndemand that the Iraqi regime cooperate fully with\\ninspectors, condemning Iraq's serious violations of its\\nobligations. The Security Council again renewed that\\ndemand in 1994 and twice more in 1996, deploring\\nIraq's clear violations of its obligations. The Security\\nCouncil renewed its demand three more times in 1997,\\nciting flagrant violations, and three more times in\\n1998, calling Iraq's behaviour totally unacceptable.\\nAnd in 1999, the demand was renewed yet again.\\nAs we meet today, it has been almost four years\\nsince the last United Nations inspector set foot in\\nIraq — four years for the Iraqi regime to plan and to\\nbuild and to test behind the cloak of secrecy. We know\\nthat Saddam Hussein pursued weapons of mass murder\\neven when inspectors were in his country. Are we to\\nassume that he stopped when they left? The history, the\\nlogic and the facts lead to one conclusion. Saddam\\nHussein's regime is a grave and gathering danger. To\\nsuggest otherwise is to hope against the evidence. To\\nassume this regime's good faith is to bet the lives of\\nmillions and the peace of the world in a reckless\\ngamble. And that is a risk we must not take.\\nWe have been more than patient. We have tried\\nsanctions. We have tried the carrot of oil-for-food and\\nthe stick of coalition military strikes. But Saddam\\nHussein has defied all those efforts and continues to\\ndevelop weapons of mass destruction. The first time we\\nmay be completely certain he has nuclear weapons is\\nwhen, God forbid, he uses one. We owe it to all our\\ncitizens to do everything in our power to prevent that\\nday from coming.\\nThe conduct of the Iraqi regime is a threat to the\\nauthority of the United Nations and a threat to peace.\\nIraq has answered a decade of United Nations demands\\nwith a decade of defiance. All the world now faces a\\ntest and the United Nations a difficult and defining\\nmoment. Are Security Council resolutions to be\\nhonoured and enforced or cast aside without\\nconsequence? Will the United Nations serve the\\npurpose of its founding, or will it be irrelevant?\\nThe United States helped found the United\\nNations. We want the United Nations to be effective\\nand respected and successful. We want the resolutions\\nof the world's most important multilateral body to be\\nenforced, and right now those resolutions are being\\nunilaterally subverted by the Iraqi regime. Our\\npartnership of nations can meet the test before us by\\nmaking clear what we now expect of the Iraqi regime.\\nIf the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will\\nimmediately and unconditionally forswear, disclose\\nand remove or destroy all weapons of mass destruction,\\nlong-range missiles and all related material.\\nIf the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will\\nimmediately end all support for terrorism and act to\\nsuppress it, as all States are required to do by Security\\nCouncil resolutions.\\nIf the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will cease\\npersecution of its civilian population, including Shia,\\nSunnis, Kurds, Turkomans and others — again, as\\nrequired by Security Council resolutions.\\nIf the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will release or\\naccount for all Gulf war personnel whose fate is still\\nunknown. It will return the remains of any who are\\ndeceased, return stolen property, accept liability for\\nlosses resulting from the invasion of Kuwait and fully\\ncooperate with international efforts to resolve those\\nissues, as required by Security Council resolutions.\\nIf the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will\\nimmediately end all illicit trade outside the oil-for-food\\nprogramme. It will accept United Nations\\nadministration of funds from that programme, to ensure\\nthat the money is used fairly and promptly for the\\nbenefit of the Iraqi people.\\nIf all those steps are taken, it will signal a new\\nopenness and accountability in Iraq. And it could open\\nthe prospect of the United Nations helping to build a\\nGovernment that represents all Iraqis — a Government\\nbased on respect for human rights, economic liberty\\nand internationally supervised elections.\\nThe United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi\\npeople. They have suffered too long in silent captivity.\\nLiberty for the Iraqi people is a great moral cause and a\\ngreat strategic goal. The people of Iraq deserve it. The\\nsecurity of all nations requires it.\\nFree societies do not intimidate through cruelty\\nand conquest, and open societies do not threaten the\\nworld with mass murder. The United States supports\\npolitical and economic liberty in a unified Iraq.\\n9\\n\\nWe can harbour no illusions, and that is important\\ntoday to remember. Saddam Hussein attacked Iran in\\n1980 and Kuwait in 1990. He has fired ballistic\\nmissiles at Iran and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Israel.\\nHis regime once ordered the killing of every person\\nbetween the ages of 15 and 70 in certain Kurdish\\nvillages in northern Iraq. He has gassed many Iranians\\nand 40 Iraqi villages.\\nMy nation will work with the Security Council to\\nmeet our common challenge. If Iraq's regime defies us\\nagain, the world must move deliberately and decisively\\nto hold Iraq to account. We will work with the Security\\nCouncil for the necessary resolutions. But the purposes\\nof the United States should not be doubted. The\\nSecurity Council resolutions will be enforced, and the\\njust demands of peace and security will be met, or\\naction will be unavoidable, and a regime that has lost\\nits legitimacy will also lose its power.\\nEvents can turn in one of two ways.\\nIf we fail to act in the face of danger, the people\\nof Iraq will continue to live in brutal submission. The\\nregime will have new power to bully, dominate and\\nconquer its neighbours, condemning the Middle East to\\nmore years of bloodshed and fear. The region will\\nremain unstable, with little hope of freedom, and\\nisolated from the progress of our times. With every step\\nthe Iraqi regime takes towards gaining and deploying\\nthe most terrible weapons, our own options to confront\\nthat regime will narrow. And if an emboldened regime\\nwere to supply these weapons to terrorist allies, then\\nthe attacks of 11 September would be a prelude to far\\ngreater horrors.\\nIf we meet our responsibilities, if we overcome\\nthis danger, we can arrive at a very different future.\\nThe people of Iraq can shake off their captivity. They\\ncan one day join a democratic Afghanistan and a\\ndemocratic Palestine, inspiring reforms throughout the\\nMuslim world. These nations can show by their\\nexample that honest government, respect for women,\\nand the great Islamic tradition of learning can triumph\\nin the Middle East and beyond. We will show that the\\npromise of the United Nations can be fulfilled in our\\ntime.\\nNeither of these outcomes is certain. Both have\\nbeen set before us. We must choose between a world of\\nfear and a world of progress. We cannot stand by and\\ndo nothing while dangers gather. We must stand up for\\nour security and for the permanent rights and hopes of\\nmankind. By heritage and by choice, the United States\\nof America will make that stand. Representatives to the\\nUnited Nations have the power to make that stand as\\nwell.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n","      <td>16684</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5191</th>\n","      <td>58</td>\n","      <td>2003</td>\n","      <td>USA</td>\n","      <td>United States</td>\n","      <td>George W.

Since that day,\\nterrorists have struck in Bali, in Mombassa, in\\n9\\n\\nCasablanca, in Riyadh, in Jakarta, in Jerusalem,\\nmeasuring the advance of their cause in the chaos and\\ninnocent suffering they leave behind.\\nLast month, terrorists brought their war to the\\nUnited Nations itself. The United Nations headquarters\\nin Baghdad stood for order and compassion. For that\\nreason, the terrorists decided it must be destroyed.\\nAmong the 22 people who were murdered was Sergio\\nVieira de Mello. Over the decades, that good and brave\\nman from Brazil gave help to the afflicted in\\nBangladesh, Cyprus, Mozambique, Lebanon,\\nCambodia, Central Africa, Kosovo and East Timor, and\\nwas aiding the people of Iraq in their time of need.\\nAmerica joins you, his colleagues, in honouring the\\nmemory of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and the memory\\nof all those who died with him in the service of the\\nUnited Nations.\\nBy the victims they choose and by the means they\\nuse, the terrorists have clarified the struggle we are in.\\nThose who target relief workers for death have set\\nthemselves against all humanity. Those who incite\\nmurder and celebrate suicide reveal their contempt for\\nlife itself. They have no place in any religious faith,\\nthey have no claim on the world's sympathy, and they\\nshould have no friend in this Hall.\\nEvents during the past two years have set before\\nus the clearest of divides: between those who seek\\norder and those who spread chaos, between those who\\nwork for peaceful change and those who adopt the\\nmethods of gangsters, between those who honour the\\nrights of man and those who deliberately take the lives\\nof men, women and children without mercy or shame.\\nBetween those alternatives there is no neutral\\nground. All Governments that support terror are\\ncomplicit in a war against civilization. No Government\\nshould ignore the threat of terror because to look the\\nother way gives terrorists the chance to regroup, recruit\\nand prepare. All nations that fight terror as if the lives\\nof their own people depended on it will earn the\\nfavourable judgement of history.\\nThe former regimes of Afghanistan and Iraq knew\\nthose alternatives and made their choices. The Taliban\\nwas a sponsor and servant of terrorism. When\\nconfronted, that regime chose defiance, and that regime\\nis no more. Afghanistan's President, who is here today,\\nnow represents a free people who are building a decent\\nand just society. They are building a nation fully joined\\nin the war against terror.\\nThe regime of Saddam Hussain cultivated ties to\\nterror while it built weapons of mass destruction. It\\nused those weapons in acts of mass murder and refused\\nto account for them when confronted by the world. The\\nSecurity Council was right to be alarmed. The Security\\nCouncil was right to demand that Iraq destroy its\\nillegal weapons and prove that it had done so. The\\nSecurity Council was right to vow serious\\nconsequences if Iraq refused to comply. And because\\nthere were consequences   because a coalition of\\nnations acted to defend the peace and the credibility of\\nthe United Nations   Iraq is free, and today we are\\njoined by the representatives of a liberated country.\\nSaddam Hussain's monuments have been\\nremoved, and not only his statues. The true monuments\\nof his rule and his character   the torture chambers,\\nthe rape rooms and the prison cells for innocent\\nchildren   are closed. And as we discover the killing\\nfields and mass graves of Iraq, the true scale of\\nSaddam's cruelty is being revealed.\\nThe Iraqi people are meeting hardships and\\nchallenges, like every nation that has set out on the\\npath of democracy. Yet, their future promises lives of\\ndignity and freedom, and that is a world away from the\\nsqualid, vicious tyranny they have known. Across Iraq,\\nlife is being improved by liberty. Across the Middle\\nEast, people are safer because an unstable aggressor\\nhas been removed from power. Across the world,\\nnations are more secure because an ally of terror has\\nfallen.\\nOur actions in Afghanistan and Iraq were\\nsupported by many Governments, and America is\\ngrateful to each one. I also recognize that some of the\\nsovereign nations of the Assembly disagreed with our\\nactions. Yet, there was and there remains unity among\\nus on the fundamental principles and objectives of the\\nUnited Nations. We are dedicated to the defence of our\\ncollective security and to the advance of human rights.\\nThose permanent commitments call us to great work in\\nthe world, work that we must do together. So, let us\\nmove forward. First, we must stand with the people of\\nAfghanistan and Iraq as they build free and stable\\ncountries. The terrorists and their allies fear and fight\\nthis progress above all because free people embrace\\nhope over resentment and choose peace over violence.\\nThe United Nations has been a friend of the\\nAfghan people, distributing food and medicine, helping\\nrefugees return home, advising on a new constitution\\n10\\n\\nand helping to prepare the way for nationwide\\nelections. NATO has taken over the United Nations\\nmandated security force in Kabul. American and\\ncoalition forces continue to track and defeat al Qaeda\\nterrorists and the remnants of the Taliban. Our efforts\\nto rebuild that country go on. I have recently proposed\\nto spend an additional $1.2 billion for the Afghan\\nreconstruction effort, and I urge other nations to\\ncontinue contributing to that important cause.\\nIn the nation of Iraq, the United Nations is\\ncarrying out vital and effective work every day. By the\\nend of 2004, more than 90 per cent of Iraqi children\\nunder age five will have been immunized against\\npreventable diseases such as polio, tuberculosis and\\nmeasles, thanks to the hard work and high ideals of\\nUNICEF. Iraq's food distribution system is operational,\\ndelivering nearly a half million tons of food per month,\\nthanks to the skill and expertise of the World Food\\nProgramme.\\nOur international coalition in Iraq is meeting its\\nresponsibilities. We are conducting precision raids\\nagainst terrorists and holdouts of the former regime.\\nThose killers are at war with the Iraqi people. They\\nhave made Iraq the central front in the war on terror.\\nAnd they will be defeated. Our coalition has made sure\\nthat Iraq's former dictator will never again use\\nweapons of mass destruction. We are now interviewing\\nIraqi citizens and analysing records of the old regime\\nto reveal the full extent of its weapons programmes and\\nits long campaign of deception. We are training Iraqi\\npolice, border guards and a new army so that the Iraqi\\npeople can assume full responsibility for their own\\nsecurity.\\nAt the same time, our coalition is helping to\\nimprove the daily lives of the Iraqi people. The old\\nregime built palaces while letting schools decay, so we\\nare rebuilding more than a thousand schools. The old\\nregime starved hospitals of resources, so we have\\nhelped to supply and reopen hospitals across Iraq. The\\nold regime built up armies and weapons while allowing\\nthe nation's infrastructure to crumble, so we are\\nrehabilitating power plants, water and sanitation\\nfacilities, bridges and airports. I have proposed to\\nCongress that the United States provide additional\\nfunding for our work in Iraq, the greatest financial\\ncommitment of its kind since the Marshall Plan.\\nHaving helped to liberate Iraq, we will honour\\nour pledges to Iraq, and by helping the Iraqi people\\nbuild a stable and peaceful country we will make our\\nown countries more secure.\\nThe primary goal of our coalition in Iraq is self-\\ngovernment for the people of Iraq, reached by an\\norderly and democratic process. That process must\\nunfold according to the needs of Iraqis, neither hurried\\nnor delayed by the wishes of other parties. And the\\nUnited Nations can contribute greatly to the cause of\\nIraqi self-government.\\nAmerica is working with friends and allies on a\\nnew Security Council resolution, which will expand the\\nUnited Nation's role in Iraq. As in the aftermath of\\nother conflicts, the United Nations should assist in\\ndeveloping a constitution, training civil servants and\\nconducting free and fair elections. Iraq now has a\\nGoverning Council, the first truly representative\\ninstitution in that country. Iraq's new leaders are\\nshowing the openness and tolerance that democracy\\nrequires, and they are also showing courage. Yet every\\nyoung democracy needs the help of friends. Now the\\nnation of Iraq needs and deserves our aid, and all\\nnations of good will should step forward and provide\\nthat support.\\nThe success of a free Iraq will be watched and\\nnoted throughout the region. Millions will see that\\nfreedom, equality and material progress are possible at\\nthe heart of the Middle East. Leaders in the region will\\nface the clearest evidence that free institutions and\\nopen societies are the only path to long-term national\\nsuccess and dignity. And a transformed Middle East\\nwould benefit the entire world by undermining the\\nideologies that export violence to other lands.\\nIraq as a dictatorship had great power to\\ndestabilize the Middle East. Iraq as a democracy will\\nhave great power to inspire the Middle East. The\\nadvance of democratic institutions in Iraq is setting an\\nexample that others, including the Palestinian people,\\nwould be wise to follow. The Palestinian cause is\\nbetrayed by leaders who cling to power by feeding old\\nhatreds and destroying the good work of others. The\\nPalestinian people deserve their own State. They will\\ngain that State by embracing new leaders committed to\\nreform, to fighting terror and to building peace.\\nAll parties in the Middle East must meet their\\nresponsibilities and carry out the commitments they\\nmade at Aqaba. Israel must work to create the\\nconditions that will allow a peaceful Palestinian State\\nto emerge. Arab nations must cut off funding and other\\n11\\n\\nsupport for terrorist organizations. America will work\\nwith every nation in the region that acts boldly for the\\nsake of peace.\\nA second challenge we must confront together is\\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\\nOutlaw regimes that possess nuclear, chemical and\\nbiological weapons and the means to deliver them\\nwould be able to use blackmail and create chaos in\\nentire regions. Those weapons could be used by\\nterrorists to bring sudden disaster and suffering on a\\nscale we can scarcely imagine. The deadly combination\\nof outlaw regimes, terror networks and weapons of\\nmass murder is a peril that cannot be ignored or wished\\naway. If such a danger is allowed to fully materialize,\\nall words, all protests, will come too late.\\nNations of the world must have the wisdom and\\nthe will to stop grave threats before they arrive. One\\ncrucial step is to secure the most dangerous materials at\\ntheir source. For more than a decade, the United States\\nhas worked with Russia and other States of the former\\nSoviet Union to dismantle, destroy or secure weapons\\nand dangerous materials left over from another era.\\nLast year in Canada, the G-8 nations agreed to\\nprovide up to 20 billion dollars, half of it from the\\nUnited States, to fight this proliferation risk over the\\nnext ten years. Since then, six additional countries have\\njoined the effort. More are needed, and I urge other\\nnations to help us meet this danger.\\nWe are also improving our capability to interdict\\nlethal materials in transit. Through our Proliferation\\nSecurity Initiative, eleven nations are preparing to\\nsearch planes, ships, trains and trucks carrying suspect\\ncargo and to seize weapons or missile shipments that\\nraise proliferation concerns. These nations have agreed\\non a set of interdiction principles consistent with\\ncurrent legal authorities, and we are working to expand\\nthe Proliferation Security Initiative to other countries.\\nWe are determined to keep the world's most destructive\\nweapons away from all our shores and out of the hands\\nof our common enemies.\\nBecause proliferators will use any route or\\nchannel that is open to them, we need the broadest\\npossible cooperation to stop them. Today I ask the\\nUnited Nations Security Council to adopt a new\\nantiproliferation resolution. That resolution should call\\non all Members of the United Nations to criminalize\\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, to\\nenact strict export controls consistent with international\\nstandards and to secure any and all sensitive materials\\nwithin their own borders. The United States stands\\nready to help any nation draft these new laws and to\\nassist in their enforcement.\\nA third challenge we share is a challenge to our\\nconscience. We must act decisively to meet the\\nhumanitarian crises of our time. The United States has\\nbegun to carry out the Emergency Plan for AIDS\\nRelief, aimed at preventing AIDS on a massive scale\\nand treating millions who have the disease already. We\\nhave pledged 15 billion dollars over five years to fight\\nAIDS around the world.\\nMy country is acting to save lives from famine as\\nwell. We are providing more than 1.4 billion dollars in\\nglobal emergency food aid, and I have asked our\\nUnited States Congress for 200 million dollars for a\\nnew famine fund so that we can act quickly when the\\nfirst signs of famine appear. Every nation on every\\ncontinent should generously add their resources to the\\nfight against disease and desperate hunger.\\nThere is another humanitarian crisis, spreading,\\nyet hidden from view. Each year, an estimated eight to\\nnine hundred thousand human beings are bought, sold\\nor forced across the world's borders. Among them are\\nhundreds of thousands of teenage girls and others as\\nyoung as five who fall victim to the sex trade. This\\ncommerce in human life generates billions of dollars\\neach year, much of which is used to finance organized\\ncrime. There is a special evil in the abuse and\\nexploitation of the most innocent and vulnerable. The\\nvictims of the sex trade see little of life before they see\\nthe very worst of life   an underground of brutality\\nand lonely fear. Those who create these victims and\\nprofit from their suffering must be severely punished.\\nThose who patronize this industry debase themselves\\nand deepen the misery of others, and Governments that\\ntolerate this trade are tolerating a form of slavery.\\nThis problem has appeared in my own country\\nand we are working to stop it. The Protect Act, which I\\nsigned into law this year, makes it a crime for any\\nperson to enter the United States or for any citizen to\\ntravel abroad for the purpose of sex tourism involving\\nchildren. The Department of Justice is actively\\ninvestigating sex tour operators and patrons, who can\\nface up to 30 years in prison. Under the Trafficking\\nVictims Protection Act, the United States is using\\nsanctions against Governments to discourage human\\ntrafficking.\\n12\\n\\nThe victims of this industry also need help from\\nMembers of the United Nations. This begins with clear\\nstandards and the certainty of punishment under the\\nlaws of every country. Today, some nations make it a\\ncrime to sexually abuse children abroad. Such conduct\\nshould be a crime in all nations. Governments should\\ninform travellers of the harm this industry does and the\\nsevere punishments that will fall on its patrons. The\\nAmerican Government is committing $50 million to\\nsupport the good work of organizations that are\\nrescuing women and children from exploitation and\\ngiving them shelter, medical treatment and the hope of\\na new life. I urge other Governments to do their part.\\nWe must show new energy in fighting back an old\\nevil. Nearly two centuries after the abolition of the\\ntransatlantic slave trade and more than a century after\\nslavery was officially ended in its last strongholds, the\\ntrade in human beings for any purpose must not be\\nallowed to thrive in our time.\\nAll the challenges I have spoken of this morning\\nrequire urgent attention and moral clarity. Helping\\nAfghanistan and Iraq to succeed as free nations in a\\ntransformed region; cutting off the avenues of\\nproliferation; abolishing modern forms of slavery  \\nthese are the kinds of great tasks for which the United\\nNations was founded. In each case, careful discussion\\nis needed and, also, decisive action. Our good\\nintentions will be credited only if we achieve good\\noutcomes. As an original signer of the United Nations\\nCharter, the United States of America is committed to\\nthe United Nations and we show that commitment by\\nworking to fulfil the United Nations stated purposes\\nand by giving meaning to its ideals.\\nThe founding documents of the United Nations\\nand the founding documents of America stand in the\\nsame tradition. Both assert that human beings should\\nnever be reduced to objects of power or commerce,\\nbecause their dignity is inherent. Both recognize a\\nmoral law that stands above men and nations, but\\nwhich must be defended and enforced by men and\\nnations. And both point the way to peace   the peace\\nthat comes when all are free. We secure that peace with\\nour courage and we must show that courage together.\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n","      <td>16962</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5382</th>\n","      <td>59</td>\n","      <td>2004</td>\n","      <td>USA</td>\n","      <td>United States</td>\n","      <td>Mr. George W Bush</td>\n","      <td>President</td>\n","      <td>Thank you for the honour of\\naddressing the General Assembly.

Welcome to New\\nYork City, and welcome to the United States of\\nAmerica.\\nDuring the past three years, I have addressed the\\nGeneral Assembly in a time of tragedy for my country,\\nand in times of decision for all of us. Now we gather at\\na time of tremendous opportunity for the United\\nNations and for all peaceful nations. For decades, the\\ncircle of liberty, security and development has been\\nexpanding in our world. This progress has brought\\nunity to Europe, self-government to Latin America and\\nAsia and new hope to Africa. Now we have the historic\\n8\\n\\nchance to widen the circle even further, to fight\\nradicalism and terror with justice and dignity and to\\nachieve a true peace, founded on human freedom.\\nThe United Nations and my country share the\\ndeepest commitments. Both the American Declaration\\nof Independence and the Universal Declaration of\\nHuman Rights proclaim the equal value and dignity of\\nevery human life. That dignity is honoured by the rule\\nof law, limits on the power of the State, respect for\\nwomen, protection of private property, free speech,\\nequal justice and religious tolerance. That dignity is\\ndishonoured by oppression, corruption, tyranny,\\nbigotry, terrorism and all violence against the innocent.\\nBoth our founding documents affirm that this bright\\nline between justice and injustice — between right and\\nwrong — is the same in every age, every culture and\\nevery nation.\\nWise Governments also stand for these principles\\nfor very practical and realistic reasons. We know that\\ndictators are quick to choose aggression, while free\\nnations strive to resolve differences in peace. We know\\nthat oppressive Governments support terror, while free\\nGovernments fight the terrorists in their midst. We\\nknow that free peoples embrace progress and life,\\ninstead of becoming the recruits for murderous\\nideologies.\\nEvery nation that wants peace will share the\\nbenefits of a freer world. And every nation that seeks\\npeace has an obligation to help build that world.\\nEventually there is no safe isolation from terror\\nnetworks, or failed States that shelter them, or outlaw\\nregimes or weapons of mass destruction. Eventually\\nthere is no safety in looking away, seeking the quiet\\nlife by ignoring the struggles and oppression of others.\\nIn this young century our world needs a new\\ndefinition of security. Our security is not merely found\\nin spheres of influence or some balance of power. The\\nsecurity of our world is found in the advancing rights\\nof mankind.\\nThose rights are advancing across the world. And\\nacross the world, the enemies of human rights are\\nresponding with violence. Terrorists and their allies\\nbelieve the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and\\nthe United States Bill of Rights and every charter of\\nliberty ever written are lies to be burned and destroyed\\nand forgotten. They believe that dictators should\\ncontrol every mind and tongue in the Middle East and\\nbeyond. They believe that suicide and torture and\\nmurder are fully justified to serve any goal they\\ndeclare. And they act on their beliefs.\\nIn the last year alone terrorists have attacked\\npolice stations and banks and commuter trains and\\nsynagogues and a school filled with children. This\\nmonth in Beslan we saw once again how the terrorists\\nmeasure their success in the death of the innocent and\\nin the pain of grieving families. Svetlana Dzebisov was\\nheld hostage along with her son and her nephew. Her\\nnephew did not survive. She recently visited the\\ncemetery and saw what she called the “little graves”.\\nShe said, “I understand that there is evil in the world,\\nbut what have these little creatures done?”\\nThe Russian children did nothing to deserve such\\nawful suffering and fright and death. The people of\\nMadrid and Jerusalem and Istanbul and Baghdad have\\ndone nothing to deserve sudden and random murder.\\nThose acts violate the standards of justice in all\\ncultures and the principles of all religions. All civilized\\nnations are in this struggle together and all must fight\\nthe murderers.\\nWe are determined to destroy terror networks\\nwherever they operate, and the United States is grateful\\nto every nation that is helping to seize terrorist assets,\\ntrack down their operatives and disrupt their plans. We\\nare determined to end the State sponsorship of terror,\\nand my nation is grateful to all that participated in the\\nliberation of Afghanistan. We are determined to\\nprevent proliferation and to enforce the demands of the\\nworld, and my nation is grateful to the soldiers of many\\nnations who have helped to deliver the Iraqi people\\nfrom an outlaw dictator.\\nThe dictator agreed in 1991, as a condition of a\\nceasefire, to fully comply with all Security Council\\nresolutions, then ignored more than a decade of those\\nresolutions. Finally, the Security Council promised\\nserious consequences for his defiance. The\\ncommitments we make must have meaning. When we\\nsay “serious consequences”, for the sake of peace there\\nmust be serious consequences. So a coalition of nations\\nenforced the just demands of the world.\\nDefending our ideals is vital, but it is not enough.\\nOur broader mission as United Nations Members is to\\napply those ideals to the great issues of our time. Our\\nwider goal is to promote hope and progress as the\\nalternatives to hatred and violence. Our great purpose\\nis to build a better world beyond the war on terror.\\n9\\n\\nBecause we believe in human dignity, the United\\nStates and many other nations have established a\\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.\\nIn three years the contributing countries have funded\\nprojects in more than 90 countries, and pledged a total\\nof $5.6 billion to those efforts. America has undertaken\\na $15 billion effort to provide prevention and treatment\\nand humane care in nations afflicted by AIDS, placing\\na special focus on 15 countries where the need is most\\nurgent. AIDS is the greatest health crisis of our time,\\nand our unprecedented commitment will bring new\\nhope to those who have walked too long in the shadow\\nof death.\\nBecause we believe in human dignity, the United\\nStates and many other nations have joined together to\\nconfront the evil of trafficking in human beings. We\\nare supporting organizations that rescue the victims,\\npassing stronger anti-trafficking laws and warning\\ntravellers that they will be held to account for\\nsupporting this modern form of slavery. Women and\\nchildren should never be exploited for pleasure or\\ngreed, anywhere on Earth.\\nBecause we believe in human dignity, we should\\ntake seriously the protection of life from exploitation\\nunder any pretext. In this session, the General\\nAssembly will consider a draft resolution sponsored by\\nCosta Rica calling for a comprehensive ban on human\\ncloning. I support that draft resolution and urge all\\nGovernments to affirm a basic ethical principle: no\\nhuman life should ever be produced or destroyed for\\nthe benefit of another.\\nBecause we believe in human dignity, the United\\nStates and many other nations have changed the way\\nwe fight poverty, curb corruption and provide aid. In\\n2002 we created the Monterrey Consensus, a bold\\napproach that links new aid from developed nations to\\nreal reform in developing ones. And through the\\nMillennium Challenge Account, my nation is\\nincreasing our aid to developing nations that expand\\neconomic freedom and invest in the education and\\nhealth of their own people.\\nBecause we believe in human dignity, the United\\nStates and many other nations have acted to lift the\\ncrushing burden of debt that limits the growth of\\ndeveloping economies and holds millions of people in\\npoverty. Since those efforts began in 1996, poor\\ncountries with the heaviest debt burdens have received\\nmore than $30 billion of relief. And to prevent the\\nbuild-up of future debt, my country and other nations\\nhave agreed that international financial institutions\\nshould increasingly provide new aid in the form of\\ngrants rather than loans.\\nBecause we believe in human dignity, the world\\nmust have more effective means to stabilize regions in\\nturmoil and to halt religious violence and ethnic\\ncleansing. We must create permanent capabilities to\\nrespond to future crises.\\nThe United States and Italy have proposed a\\nGlobal Peace Operations Initiative. Group of Eight\\n(G-8) countries will train 75,000 peacekeepers —\\ninitially from Africa — so they can conduct operations\\non that continent and elsewhere. The countries of the\\nG-8 will help that peacekeeping force with deployment\\nand logistical needs.\\nAt this hour, the world is witnessing terrible\\nsuffering and horrible crimes in the Darfur region of\\nthe Sudan, crimes my Government has concluded are\\ngenocide. The United States played a key role in efforts\\nto broker a ceasefire, and we are providing\\nhumanitarian assistance to the Sudanese people.\\nRwanda and Nigeria have deployed forces in the Sudan\\nto help improve security so that aid can be delivered.\\nThe Security Council adopted a new resolution that\\nsupports an expanded African Union force to help\\nprevent further bloodshed and that urges the\\nGovernment of the Sudan to stop flights by military\\naircraft in Darfur. We congratulate the members of the\\nCouncil on this timely and necessary action. I call on\\nthe Government of the Sudan to honour the ceasefire it\\nsigned, and to stop the killing in Darfur.\\nBecause we believe in human dignity, peaceful\\nnations must stand for the advance of democracy. No\\nother system of government has done more to protect\\nminorities, to secure the rights of labour, to raise the\\nstatus of women or to channel human energy to the\\npursuits of peace. We have witnessed the rise of\\ndemocratic Governments in predominantly Hindu and\\nMuslim, Buddhist, Jewish and Christian cultures.\\nDemocratic institutions have taken root in modern\\nsocieties and in traditional societies. When it comes to\\nthe desire for liberty and justice, there is no clash of\\ncivilizations. People everywhere are capable of\\nfreedom and worthy of freedom.\\nFinding the full promise of representative\\nGovernment takes time, as America has found in two\\ncenturies of debate and struggle. Nor is there only one\\n10\\n\\nform of representative Government, because\\ndemocracies by definition take on the unique character\\nof the peoples that create them. Yet this much we know\\nwith certainty: the desire for freedom resides in every\\nhuman heart, and that desire cannot be contained\\nforever by prison walls or martial laws or secret police.\\nOver time and across the Earth, freedom will find a\\nway.\\nFreedom is finding a way in Iraq and\\nAfghanistan, and we must continue to show our\\ncommitment to democracies in those nations. The\\nliberty that many have won at a cost must be secured.\\nAs Members of the United Nations, we all have a stake\\nin the success of the world’s newest democracies. Not\\nlong ago, outlaw regimes in Baghdad and Kabul\\nthreatened the peace and sponsored terrorists. Those\\nregimes destabilized one of the world’s most vital and\\nmost volatile regions. They brutalized their peoples in\\ndefiance of all civilized norms.\\nToday, the Iraqi and Afghan peoples are on the\\npath to democracy and freedom. The Governments that\\nare rising will pose no threat to others. Instead of\\nharbouring terrorists, they are fighting terrorist groups.\\nAnd this progress is good for the long-term security of\\nall of us. The Afghan people are showing extraordinary\\ncourage under difficult conditions. They are fighting to\\ndefend their nation from Taliban hold-outs and helping\\nto strike against the terrorist killers. They are reviving\\ntheir economy. They have adopted a Constitution\\nthat protects the rights of all, while honouring their\\nnation’s most cherished traditions. More than 10\\nmillion Afghan citizens — over four million of them\\nwomen — are now registered to vote in next month’s\\npresidential election. To any who still would question\\nwhether Muslim societies can be democratic societies,\\nthe Afghan people are giving their answer.\\nSince the last general debate of this General\\nAssembly, the people of Iraq have regained\\nsovereignty. Today, in this Hall, the Prime Minister of\\nIraq and his delegation represent a country that has\\nrejoined the community of nations. The Government of\\nPrime Minister Allawi has earned the support of every\\nnation that believes in self-determination and desires\\npeace. And under Security Council resolutions 1511\\n(2003) and 1546 (2004), the world is providing that\\nsupport. The United Nations and its Member nations\\nmust respond to Prime Minister Allawi’s request and\\ndo more to help build an Iraq that is secure,\\ndemocratic, federal and free.\\nA democratic Iraq has ruthless enemies because\\nterrorists know the stakes in that country. They know\\nthat a free Iraq in the heart of the Middle East will be a\\ndecisive blow against their ambitions for that region.\\nSo a terrorist group associated with Al Qaeda is now\\none of the main groups killing the innocent in Iraq\\ntoday, conducting a campaign of bombings against\\ncivilians and the beheadings of bound men. Coalition\\nforces now serving in Iraq are confronting the terrorists\\nand foreign fighters so that peaceful nations around the\\nworld will never have to face them within our own\\nborders.\\nOur coalition is standing beside a growing Iraqi\\nsecurity force. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization\\nis providing vital training to that force. More than 35\\nnations have contributed money and expertise to help\\nrebuild Iraq’s infrastructure and, as the Iraqi Interim\\nGovernment moves towards national elections,\\nofficials from the United Nations are helping Iraqis\\nbuild the infrastructure of democracy. Those selfless\\npeople are doing heroic work and are carrying on the\\ngreat legacy of Sergio Vieira de Mello.\\nAs we have seen in other countries, one of the\\nmain terrorist goals is to undermine, disrupt and\\ninfluence election outcomes. We can expect terrorist\\nattacks to escalate as Afghanistan and Iraq approach\\nnational elections. The work ahead is demanding, but\\nthose difficulties will not shake our conviction that the\\nfuture of Afghanistan and Iraq is a future of liberty.\\nThe proper response to difficulty is not to retreat — it\\nis to prevail.\\nThe advance of freedom always carries a cost,\\npaid by the bravest among us. America mourns the\\nlosses to our nation and to many others, and today I\\nassure every friend of Afghanistan and Iraq, and every\\nenemy of liberty: We will stand with the people of\\nAfghanistan and Iraq until their hopes of freedom and\\nsecurity are fulfilled.\\nThese two nations will be a model for the broader\\nMiddle East, a region where millions have been denied\\nbasic human rights and simple justice. For too long,\\nmany nations, including my own, tolerated and even\\nexcused oppression in the Middle East in the name of\\nstability. Oppression became common, but stability\\nnever arrived. We must take a different approach. We\\nmust help the reformers of the Middle East as they\\nwork for freedom and strive to build a community of\\npeaceful, democratic nations.\\n11\\n\\nThat commitment to democratic reform is\\nessential to resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. Peace\\nwill not be achieved by Palestinian rulers who\\nintimidate opposition, tolerate corruption and maintain\\nties to terrorist groups. The long-suffering Palestinian\\npeople deserve better. They deserve true leaders\\ncapable of creating and governing a free and peaceful\\nPalestinian State.\\nEven after the setbacks and frustrations of recent\\nmonths, good will and hard effort can achieve the\\npromise of the road map to peace. Those who would\\nlead a new Palestinian State should adopt peaceful\\nmeans to achieve the rights of their people and create\\nthe reformed institutions of a stable democracy. Arab\\nStates should end incitement in their own media, cut\\noff public and private funding for terrorism, and\\nestablish normal relations with Israel. Israel should\\nimpose a settlement freeze, dismantle unauthorized\\noutposts, end the daily humiliation of the Palestinian\\npeople, and avoid any actions that prejudice final\\nnegotiations. And world leaders should withdraw all\\nfavour and support from any Palestinian ruler who fails\\nhis people and betrays their cause.\\nThe democratic hopes we see growing in the\\nMiddle East are growing everywhere. In the words of\\nthe Burmese democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi:\\n“We do not accept the notion that democracy is a\\nWestern value. To the contrary, democracy simply\\nmeans good Government rooted in responsibility,\\ntransparency and accountability.”\\nHere at the United Nations, Members know this to be\\ntrue. In recent years, this Organization has helped\\ncreate a new democracy in East Timor and the United\\nNations has aided other nations in making the\\ntransition to self-rule.\\nBecause I believe that the advance of liberty is\\nthe path to both a safer and better world, today I\\npropose establishing a democracy fund within the\\nUnited Nations. This is a great calling for this great\\nOrganization. The fund would help countries lay the\\nfoundations of democracy by instituting the rule of law,\\nindependent courts, a free press, political parties and\\ntrade unions. Money from the fund would also help set\\nup voter precincts and polling places and support the\\nwork of election monitors. To show our commitment to\\nthe new democracy fund, the United States will make\\nan initial contribution, and I urge all other nations to\\ncontribute as well.\\nToday I have outlined a broad agenda to advance\\nhuman dignity and enhance the security of all of us.\\nThe defeat of terror, the protection of human rights, the\\nspread of prosperity, the advance of democracy —\\nthese causes, these ideals, call us to great work in the\\nworld. Each of us alone can only do so much. Together\\nwe can accomplish so much more.\\nHistory will honour the high ideals of this\\nOrganization. The Charter states them with clarity: “to\\nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war ...\\nto reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights ... to\\npromote social progress and better standards of life in\\nlarger freedom”.\\nLet history also record that our generation of\\nleaders followed through on these ideals, even in\\nadversity. Let history show that in a decisive decade,\\nmembers of the United Nations did not grow weary in\\nour duties, or waver in meeting them. I am confident\\nthat this young century will be liberty’s century. I\\nbelieve we will rise to this moment, because I know the\\ncharacter of so many nations and leaders represented\\nhere today. And I have faith in the transforming power\\nof freedom.\\nMay God bless you.</td>\n","      <td>18628</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5760</th>\n","      <td>61</td>\n","      <td>2006</td>\n","      <td>USA</td>\n","      <td>United States</td>\n","      <td>Mr. George W.

On that \\nterrible day, extremists killed nearly 3,000 innocent \\npeople, including citizens of dozens of nations \\nrepresented right here in this Hall. Since then, the \\nenemies of humanity have continued their campaign of \\nmurder. Al-Qaida and those inspired by its extremist \\nideology have attacked more than two dozen nations. \\nAnd recently, a different group of extremists \\ndeliberately provoked a terrible conflict in Lebanon. At \\nthe start of the twenty-first century, it is clear that the \\nworld is engaged in a great ideological struggle \\nbetween extremists who use terror as a weapon to \\ncreate fear and moderate people who work for peace. \\n Five years ago, I stood at this rostrum and called \\non the community of nations to defend civilization and \\nbuild a more hopeful future. This is still the great \\nchallenge of our time. It is the calling of our \\ngeneration. This morning, I want to speak about the \\nmore hopeful world that is within our reach — a world \\nbeyond terror, where ordinary men and women are free \\nto determine their own destiny, where the voices of \\nmoderation are empowered and where the extremists \\nare marginalized by the peaceful majority. This world \\ncan be ours if we seek it and if we work together. \\n The principles of this world beyond terror can be \\nfound in the very first sentence of the Universal \\nDeclaration of Human Rights. This document declares \\nthat the “equal and inalienable rights of all members of \\nthe human family [are] the foundation of freedom, \\njustice and peace in the world”. One of the authors of \\nthis document was a Lebanese diplomat named Charles \\nMalik, who would go on to become President of this \\nAssembly. Mr. Malik insisted that these principles \\napply equally to all people, of all religions, in all \\nregions — including the men and women of the Arab \\nworld that was his home. \\n In the nearly six decades since that document was \\napproved, we have seen the forces of freedom and \\nmoderation transform entire continents. Sixty years \\nafter a terrible war, Europe is now whole, free and at \\npeace, and Asia has seen freedom progress and \\nhundreds of millions of people lifted out of desperate \\npoverty. The words of the Universal Declaration are as \\ntrue today as they were when they were written. As \\nliberty flourishes, nations grow in tolerance, and hope, \\nand peace. And we are seeing the bright future begin to \\ntake root in the broader Middle East. \\n Some of the changes in the Middle East have \\nbeen dramatic, and we see the results in this Hall. Five \\nyears ago, Afghanistan was ruled by the brutal Taliban \\nregime, and its seat in this body was contested. Now \\nthis seat is held by the freely elected Government of \\nAfghanistan, which is represented today by President \\nKarzai. Five years ago, Iraq’s seat in this body was \\n \\n \\n9 06-52731 \\n \\nheld by a dictator who killed his citizens, invaded his \\nneighbours and showed his contempt for the world by \\ndefying more than a dozen Security Council \\nresolutions. Now Iraq’s seat is held by a democratic \\nGovernment that embodies the aspirations of the Iraqi \\npeople, represented today by President Talabani. With \\nthese changes, more than 50 million people have been \\ngiven a voice in this Hall for the first time in decades. \\n Some of the changes in the Middle East are \\nhappening gradually, but they are real. Algeria has held \\nits first competitive presidential election, and the \\nmilitary remained neutral. The United Arab Emirates \\nrecently announced that half of its seats in the Federal \\nNational Council will be chosen by elections. Kuwait \\nheld elections in which women were allowed to vote \\nand run for office for the first time. Citizens have voted \\nin municipal elections in Saudi Arabia, in \\nparliamentary elections in Jordan and Bahrain and in \\nmultiparty presidential elections in Yemen and in \\nEgypt. These are important steps, and the Governments \\nshould continue to move forward with other reforms \\nthat show that they trust their people. Every nation that \\ntravels the road to freedom moves at a different pace, \\nand the democracies they build will reflect their own \\ncultures and traditions. But the destination is the same: \\na free society where people live at peace with each \\nother and at peace with the world. \\n Some have argued that the democratic changes \\nwe are seeing in the Middle East are destabilizing the \\nregion. This argument rests on a false assumption: that \\nthe Middle East was stable to begin with. The reality is \\nthat the stability we thought we saw in the Middle East \\nwas a mirage. For decades, millions of men and women \\nin the region have been trapped in oppression and \\nhopelessness. And these conditions left a generation \\ndisillusioned and made this region a breeding ground \\nfor extremism. \\n Imagine what it is like to be a young person \\nliving in a country that is not moving toward reform. \\nYou are 21 years old, and while your peers in other \\nparts of the world are casting their ballots for the first \\ntime, you are powerless to change the course of your \\nGovernment. While your peers in other parts of the \\nworld have received educations that prepare them for \\nthe opportunities of a global economy, you have been \\nfed propaganda and conspiracy theories that blame \\nothers for your country’s shortcomings. And \\neverywhere you turn, you hear extremists who tell you \\nthat you can escape your misery and regain your \\ndignity through violence and terror and martyrdom. For \\nmany across the broader Middle East, this is the dismal \\nchoice presented every day. \\n Every civilized nation, including those in the \\nMuslim world, must support those in the region who \\nare offering a more hopeful alternative. We know that \\nwhen people have a voice in their future they are less \\nlikely to blow themselves up in suicide attacks. We \\nknow that when leaders are accountable to their people, \\nthey are more likely to seek national greatness in the \\nachievements of their citizens, rather than in terror and \\nconquest. So we must stand with democratic leaders \\nand moderate reformers across the broader Middle \\nEast. We must give voice to the hopes of decent men \\nand women who want for their children the same things \\nwe want for ours. We must seek stability through a free \\nand just Middle East where the extremists are \\nmarginalized by millions of citizens in control of their \\nown destinies. \\n Today, I would like to speak directly to the \\npeople across the broader Middle East. My country \\ndesires peace. Extremists in your midst spread \\npropaganda claiming that the West is engaged in a war \\nagainst Islam. This propaganda is false, and its purpose \\nis to confuse you and justify acts of terror. We respect \\nIslam, but we will protect our people from those who \\npervert Islam to sow death and destruction. Our goal is \\nto help you build a more tolerant and hopeful society \\nthat honours people of all faiths and promotes peace. \\n To the people of Iraq: nearly 12 million of you \\nbraved the car bombers and assassins last December to \\nvote in free elections. The world saw you hold up \\npurple ink-stained fingers, and your courage filled us \\nwith admiration. You have stood firm in the face of \\nhorrendous acts of terror and sectarian violence, and \\nwe will not abandon you in your struggle to build a \\nfree nation. America and our coalition partners will \\ncontinue to stand with the democratic Government you \\nelected. We will continue to help you secure the \\ninternational assistance and investment you need to \\ncreate jobs and opportunity, working with the United \\nNations and through the International Compact with \\nIraq endorsed here in New York yesterday. We will \\ncontinue to train those of you who stepped forward to \\nfight the enemies of freedom. We will not yield the \\nfuture of your country to terrorists and extremists. In \\nreturn, your leaders must rise to the challenges your \\ncountry is facing and make difficult choices to bring \\nsecurity and prosperity. Working together, we will help \\n  \\n \\n06-52731 10 \\n \\nyour democracy succeed, so that it can become a \\nbeacon of hope for millions in the Muslim world. \\n To the people of Afghanistan: together, we \\noverthrew the Taliban regime that brought misery into \\nyour lives and harboured terrorists who brought death \\nto the citizens of many nations. Since then, we have \\nwatched you choose your leaders in free elections and \\nbuild a democratic Government. You can be proud of \\nthese achievements. We respect your courage and your \\ndetermination to live in peace and freedom. We will \\ncontinue to stand with you to defend your democratic \\ngains. \\n Today, forces from more than 40 countries, \\nincluding members of the NATO alliance, are bravely \\nserving side by side with you against the extremists \\nwho want to bring down the free Government you have \\nestablished. We will help you defeat these enemies and \\nbuild a free Afghanistan that will never again oppress \\nyou or be a safe haven for terrorists. \\n To the people of Lebanon: last year, you inspired \\nthe world when you came out into the streets to \\ndemand your independence from Syrian dominance. \\nYou drove Syrian forces from your country and you \\nre-established democracy. Since then, you have been \\ntested by the fighting that began with Hizbollah’s \\nunprovoked attacks on Israel. Many of you have seen \\nyour homes and your communities caught in crossfire. \\nWe see your suffering, and the world is helping you to \\nrebuild your country and helping you deal with the \\narmed extremists who are undermining your \\ndemocracy by acting as a State within a State. \\n The United Nations has passed a good resolution \\nthat has authorized an international force, led by \\nFrance and Italy, to help you restore Lebanese \\nsovereignty over Lebanese soil. For many years, \\nLebanon was a model of democracy and pluralism and \\nopenness in the region — and it will be again. \\n To the people of Iran: the United States respects \\nyou. We respect your country. We admire your rich \\nhistory, your vibrant culture and your many \\ncontributions to civilization. You deserve an \\nopportunity to determine your own future, an economy \\nthat rewards your intelligence and your talents and a \\nsociety that allows you to fulfil your tremendous \\npotential. The greatest obstacle to this future is that \\nyour rulers have chosen to deny you liberty and to use \\nyour nation’s resources to fund terrorism, and fuel \\nextremism, and pursue nuclear weapons. \\n The United Nations has passed a clear resolution \\nrequiring that the regime in Tehran meet its \\ninternational obligations. Iran must abandon its nuclear \\nweapons ambitions. Despite what the regime tells you, \\nwe have no objection to Iran’s pursuit of a truly \\npeaceful nuclear power programme. We are working \\ntoward a diplomatic solution to this crisis, and as we \\ndo, we look to the day when you can live in freedom \\nand America and Iran can be good friends and close \\npartners in the cause of peace. \\n To the people of Syria: your land is home to a \\ngreat people with a proud tradition of learning and \\ncommerce. Today your rulers have allowed your \\ncountry to become a crossroad for terrorism. In your \\nmidst, Hamas and Hizbollah are working to destabilize \\nthe region, and your Government is turning your \\ncountry into a tool of Iran. This is increasing your \\ncountry’s isolation from the world. Your Government \\nmust choose a better way forward by ending its support \\nfor terror, and living in peace with your neighbours, \\nand opening the way to a better life for you and your \\nfamilies. \\n To the people of Darfur: you have suffered \\nunspeakable violence, and my nation has called these \\natrocities what they are: genocide. For the last two \\nyears, America joined with the international \\ncommunity to provide emergency food aid and support \\nfor an African Union peacekeeping force. Yet your \\nsuffering continues. The world must step forward to \\nprovide additional humanitarian aid, and we must \\nstrengthen the African Union force that has done good \\nwork but is not strong enough to protect you. The \\nSecurity Council has approved a resolution that would \\ntransform the African Union force into a blue-helmeted \\nforce that is larger and more robust. To increase its \\nstrength and effectiveness, NATO nations should \\nprovide logistics and other support. The regime in \\nKhartoum is stopping the deployment of this force. If \\nthe Sudanese Government does not approve this \\npeacekeeping force quickly, the United Nations must \\nact. Your lives and the credibility of the United Nations \\nare at stake. So today I am announcing that I am \\nnaming a presidential Special Envoy — former \\nAdministrator of the United States Agency for \\nInternational Development, Andrew Natsios — to lead \\nAmerica’s efforts to resolve the outstanding disputes \\nand help bring peace to your land. \\n The world must also stand up for peace in the \\nHoly Land. I am committed to two democratic States, \\n \\n \\n11 06-52731 \\n \\nIsrael and Palestine, living side by side in peace and \\nsecurity. I am committed to a Palestinian State that has \\nterritorial integrity and will live peacefully with the \\nJewish State of Israel. This is the vision set forth in the \\nroad map, and helping the parties to reach this goal is \\none of the great objectives of my presidency. The \\nPalestinian people have suffered from decades of \\ncorruption and violence and the daily humiliation of \\noccupation. Israeli citizens have endured brutal acts of \\nterrorism and constant fear of attack since the birth of \\ntheir nation. Many brave men and women have made \\nthe commitment to peace. Yet extremists in the region \\nare stirring up hatred and trying to prevent these \\nmoderate voices from prevailing. \\n This struggle is unfolding in the Palestinian \\nterritories. Earlier this year, the Palestinian people \\nvoted in a free election. The leaders of Hamas \\ncampaigned on a platform of ending corruption and \\nimproving the lives of the Palestinian people, and they \\nprevailed. The world is waiting to see whether the \\nHamas Government will follow through on its \\npromises or pursue an extremist agenda. The world has \\nsent a clear message to the leaders of Hamas: serve the \\ninterests of the Palestinian people, abandon terror, \\nrecognize Israel’s right to exist, honour agreements and \\nwork for peace. \\n President Abbas is committed to peace and to his \\npeople’s aspirations for a State of their own. Prime \\nMinister Olmert is committed to peace, and has said he \\nintends to meet with President Abbas to make real \\nprogress on the outstanding issues between them. I \\nbelieve that peace can be achieved and that a \\ndemocratic Palestinian State is possible. I hear from \\nleaders in the region who want to help. I have directed \\nSecretary of State Rice to lead a diplomatic effort to \\nengage moderate leaders across the region to help the \\nPalestinians reform their security services and support \\nIsraeli and Palestinian leaders in their efforts to come \\ntogether to resolve their differences. \\n Prime Minister Blair has indicated that his \\ncountry will work with partners in Europe to help \\nstrengthen the governing institutions of the Palestinian \\nadministration. We welcome his initiative. Countries \\nlike Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt have made clear \\nthat they are willing to contribute the diplomatic and \\nfinancial assistance necessary to help these efforts \\nsucceed. I am optimistic that, by supporting the forces \\nof democracy and moderation, we can help Israelis and \\nPalestinians build a more hopeful future and achieve \\nthe peace in the Holy Land that we all want. \\n Freedom, by its nature, cannot be imposed; it \\nmust be chosen. From Beirut to Baghdad, people are \\nmaking the choice for freedom. And the nations \\ngathered in this Hall must make a choice as well. Will \\nwe support the moderates and reformers who are \\nworking for change across the Middle East, or will we \\nyield the future to the terrorists and extremists? \\nAmerica has made its choice: we will stand with the \\nmoderates and reformers. \\n Recently, a courageous group of Arab and \\nMuslim intellectuals wrote me a letter. In it, they said \\nthis: “The shore of reform is the only one on which any \\nlights appear, even though the journey demands \\ncourage, patience and perseverance”. The United \\nNations was created to make that journey possible. \\nTogether we must support the dreams of good and \\ndecent people who are working to transform a troubled \\nregion. And by doing so, we will advance the high \\nideals on which this institution was founded.</td>\n","      <td>16675</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5951</th>\n","      <td>62</td>\n","      <td>2007</td>\n","      <td>USA</td>\n","      <td>United States</td>\n","      <td>George W.

The document they produced is called the \\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, and it stands \\nas a landmark achievement in the history of human \\nliberty. The Declaration opens by recognizing the \\ninherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of \\nall members of the human family as the foundation of \\nfreedom and justice and peace in the world. As we \\ngather for the sixty-second session of the General \\nAssembly, the standards of the Declaration must guide \\nour work in this world.  \\n Achieving the promise of the Declaration requires \\nconfronting long-term threats. It also requires \\nanswering the immediate needs of today. \\n We nations in this Hall have our differences. Yet, \\nthere are some areas where we can all agree. When \\ninnocent people are trapped in a life of murder and \\nfear, the Declaration is not being upheld. When \\nmillions of children starve to death or perish from a \\nmosquito bite, we are not doing our duty in the world. \\nWhen whole societies are cut off from the prosperity of \\nthe global economy, we are all worse off. Changing \\nthese underlying conditions is what the Declaration \\ncalls the work of larger freedom, and it must be the \\nwork of every nation in this Assembly. \\n This great institution must work for great \\npurposes, to free people from tyranny and violence, \\nhunger and disease, illiteracy and ignorance and \\npoverty and despair. Every member of the United \\nNations must join in this mission of liberation. The \\nfirst mission of the United Nations requires liberating \\npeople from tyranny and violence. The first article of \\nthe Universal Declaration begins by stating that all \\nhuman beings are born free and equal in dignity and \\nrights. This truth is denied by terrorists and extremists \\nwho kill the innocent with the aim of imposing their \\nhateful vision on humanity. The followers of this \\nviolent ideology are a threat to civilized people \\neverywhere. All civilized nations must work together \\nto stop them by sharing intelligence about their \\nnetworks and choking off their finances and bringing to \\njustice their operatives. In the long run, the best way to \\ndefeat extremists is to defeat their dark ideology with a \\nmore hopeful vision   the vision of liberty that \\nfounded this body. \\n The United States salutes the nations that have \\nrecently taken strides towards liberty, including \\nUkraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Mauritania, Liberia, \\nSierra Leone and Morocco. The Palestinian territories \\nhave moderate leaders   mainstream leaders   who \\nare working to build free institutions that fight terror, \\nenforce the law and respond to the needs of their \\npeople. The international community must support \\nthese leaders so that we can advance the vision of two \\ndemocratic States   Israel and Palestine   living side \\nby side in peace and security. \\n Brave citizens in Lebanon and Afghanistan and \\nIraq have made the choice for democracy. Yet, the \\nextremists have responded by targeting them for \\nmurder. This is not a show of strength; it is evidence of \\nfear; and the extremists are doing everything within \\ntheir power to bring down these young democracies. \\nThe people of Lebanon and Afghanistan and Iraq have \\nasked for our help, and every civilized nation has a \\nresponsibility to stand with them. Every civilized \\nnation also has a responsibility to stand up for the \\npeople suffering under dictatorship. In Belarus, North \\nKorea, Syria and Iran, brutal regimes deny their people \\nthe fundamental rights enshrined in the Universal \\nDeclaration. \\n Americans are outraged by the situation in \\nBurma, where a military junta has imposed a 19-year \\nreign of fear. Basic freedoms of speech, assembly and \\nworship are severely restricted. Ethnic minorities are \\npersecuted. Forced child labour, human trafficking and \\nrape are common. The regime is holding more than \\n1,000 political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, \\nwhose party was elected overwhelmingly by the \\nBurmese people in 1990. \\n The ruling junta remains unyielding, yet the \\npeople’s desire for freedom is unmistakable. This \\nmorning, I am announcing a series of steps to help \\nbring peaceful change to Burma. The United States will \\ntighten economic sanctions on the leaders of the \\nregime and their financial backers. We will impose an \\nexpanded visa ban on those responsible for the most \\negregious violations of human rights   as well as their \\nfamily members. We will continue to support the \\nefforts of humanitarian groups working to alleviate \\nsuffering in Burma. And I urge the United Nations and \\nall nations to use their diplomatic and economic \\nleverage to help the Burmese people reclaim their \\nfreedom. \\n In Cuba, the long rule of a cruel dictator is \\nnearing its end. The Cuban people are ready for their \\nfreedom. And as that nation enters a period of \\ntransition, the United Nations must insist on free \\nspeech, free assembly and, ultimately, free and \\ncompetitive elections. \\n In Zimbabwe, ordinary citizens suffer under a \\ntyrannical regime. The Government has cracked down \\non peaceful calls for reform and has forced millions to \\nflee their homeland. The behaviour of the Mugabe \\nregime is an assault on its people and an affront to the \\nprinciples of the Universal Declaration. The United \\nNations must insist on change in Harare and must insist \\non freedom for the people of Zimbabwe. \\n In Sudan, innocent civilians are suffering \\nrepression; and in the Darfur region, many are losing \\ntheir lives to genocide. America has responded with \\ntough sanctions against those responsible for the \\nviolence. We have provided more than $2 billion in \\nhumanitarian and peacekeeping aid. I look forward to \\nattending a Security Council meeting that will focus on \\nDarfur, chaired by the French President. I appreciate \\nFrance’s leadership in helping to stabilize Sudan’s \\nneighbours. The United Nations must answer this \\nchallenge to conscience and live up to its promise to \\npromptly deploy peacekeeping forces to Darfur. \\n Secondly, the mission of the United Nations \\nrequires liberating people from hunger and disease. \\nArticle 25 of the Universal Declaration states that \\neveryone has the right to a standard of living adequate \\nfor the health and well-being of himself and of his \\nfamily, including food, clothing, housing, and medical \\ncare. Around the world, the United Nations is carrying \\nout noble efforts to live up to these words. \\n Feeding the hungry has long been a special \\ncalling for my nation. Today, more than half the \\nworld’s food assistance comes from America. We send \\nemergency food stocks to starving people, from camps \\nin Sudan to slums around the world. I have proposed \\nan innovative initiative to alleviate hunger under which \\nAmerica would purchase the crops of local farmers in \\nAfrica and elsewhere, rather than shipping in food \\nfrom the developed world. This would help build up \\nlocal agriculture and break the cycle of famine in the \\ndeveloping world, and I urge our United States \\nCongress to support this initiative. \\n Many in this Hall are bringing the spirit of \\ngenerosity to fighting HIV/AIDS and malaria. Five \\nyears ago, in sub-Saharan Africa, an AIDS diagnosis \\nwas widely considered a death sentence, and fewer \\nthan 50,000 people infected with the virus were \\nreceiving treatment. The world responded by creating \\nthe Global Fund, which is working with Governments \\nand the private sector to fight the disease around the \\nworld. The United States decided to take these efforts a \\nstep further by launching the $15 billion Emergency \\nPlan for AIDS Relief. Since 2003, this effort has \\nhelped bring cutting-edge medicines to more than a \\nmillion people in sub-Saharan Africa. It is a good start. \\nSo earlier this year, I proposed to double our initial \\ncommitment   to $30 billion. By coming together, the \\nworld can turn the tide against HIV/AIDS, once and for \\nall. \\n Malaria is another common killer. In some \\ncountries, malaria takes as many lives as HIV/AIDS, \\nthe vast majority of them children under the age of \\nfive. Every one of these deaths is unnecessary, because \\nthe disease is preventable and treatable. The world \\nknows what it takes to stop malaria   bed nets, indoor \\nspraying and medicine to treat the disease. Two years \\nago, America launched a $1.2 billion malaria initiative. \\nOther nations and the private sector are making vital \\ncontributions as well. I call on every Member State to \\nmaintain its focus, to find new ways to join this cause \\nand to bring us closer to the day when deaths caused by \\nmalaria are no more. \\n Thirdly, the mission of the United Nations \\nrequires liberating people from the chains of illiteracy \\nand ignorance. Article 26 of the Universal Declaration \\nstates that everyone has the right to education. When \\nnations make the investments needed to educate their \\npeople, the whole world benefits. Better education \\nunleashes the talent and potential of citizens and adds \\nto the prosperity of all of us. Better education promotes \\nbetter health and greater independence. Better \\neducation increases the strength of democracy and \\nweakens the appeal of violent ideologies. So the United \\nStates is joining with nations around the world to help \\nthem provide a better education for their people. \\n A good education starts with good teachers. In \\npartnership with other nations, America has helped \\ntrain more than 600,000 teachers and administrators. A \\ngood education requires good textbooks. So, in \\npartnership with other nations, America has distributed \\ntens of millions of textbooks. A good education \\nrequires access to good schools. So, in partnership with \\nother nations, America is helping nations raise \\nstandards in their schools at home and providing \\nscholarships to help students come to schools in the \\nUnited States. And in all our education efforts, our \\nnation is working to expand access for women and \\ngirls so that the opportunity to get a decent education is \\nopen to all. \\n Finally, the mission of the United Nations \\nrequires liberating people from poverty and despair. \\nArticle 23 of the Universal Declaration states that \\neveryone has the right to work, to free choice of \\nemployment and to just and favourable conditions of \\nwork. In the twenty-first century, this requires ensuring \\nthat people in poor countries have the same \\nopportunity to benefit from the global economy that \\ncitizens of wealthy countries have. \\n The United Nations provides vital economic \\nassistance designed to help developing nations grow \\ntheir economies and reach their potential. The United \\nStates agrees with that position. We have dramatically \\nincreased our own development assistance, and we are \\ndelivering that aid in innovative ways. We started the \\nMillennium Challenge Account to reward nations that \\ngovern justly, fight corruption, invest in their people \\nand promote economic freedom. With this aid, we are \\nreaching out to developing nations in partnership, not \\npaternalism. And we are ensuring that our aid dollars \\nreach those who need them and achieve results. \\n In the long run, the best way to lift people out of \\npoverty is through trade and investment. A nation that \\nis open and trading with the world will create \\neconomic rewards that far exceed anything it could get \\nthrough foreign aid. During the 1990s, developing \\nnations that significantly lowered tariffs saw their per \\ncapita income grow about three times faster than other \\ndeveloping countries. Open markets ignite growth, \\nencourage investment, increase transparency, \\nstrengthen the rule of law and help countries help \\nthemselves. \\n The international community now has a historic \\nchance to open markets around the world by \\nconcluding a successful Doha Round of trade talks. A \\nsuccessful Doha outcome would mean real and \\nsubstantial openings in agriculture, goods and services, \\nand real and substantial reductions in trade-distorting \\nsubsidies. The world’s largest trading nations, \\nincluding major developing countries, have a special \\nresponsibility to make the tough political decisions to \\nreduce trade barriers. America has the wi11 and \\nflexibility to make those necessary decisions. Our \\nnegotiators are demonstrating that spirit in Geneva. I \\nurge other leaders to direct their negotiators to do the \\nsame. And I am optimistic that we can reach a good \\nDoha agreement and seize this once-in-a-generation \\nopportunity. \\n In the meantime, America wi11 continue to \\npursue agreements that open trade and investment \\nwherever we can. We recently signed free-trade \\nagreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama and South \\nKorea. These agreements embody the values of open \\nmarkets, transparent and fair regulation, respect for \\nprivate property and resolving disputes under rules of \\ninternational law. These are good agreements. They are \\nnow ready for a congressional vote, and I urge our \\nCongress to approve them as soon as possible. \\n As America works with the United Nations to \\nalleviate immediate needs, we are also coming together \\nto address longer-term challenges. Together, we are \\npreparing for pandemics that could cause death and \\nsuffering on a global scale. Together, we are working \\nto stop the proliferation of weapons of mass \\ndestruction. Together, we are confronting the \\nchallenges of energy security, environmental quality \\nand climate change. I appreciate the discussions on \\nclimate change led by the Secretary-General last night. \\nI look forward to further discussions at the meeting of \\nmajor economies in Washington later this week. \\n The goals I have outlined today cannot be \\nachieved overnight, and they cannot be achieved \\nwithout reform of this vital institution. The United \\nStates is committed to a strong and vibrant United \\nNations. Yet the American people are disappointed by \\nthe failures of the Human Rights Council. That body \\nhas been silent on repression by regimes from Havana \\nand Caracas to Pyongyang and Tehran, while focusing \\nits criticism excessively on Israel. To be credible on \\nhuman rights in the world, the United Nations must \\nfirst reform its own Human Rights Council. \\n Some have also called for reform of the structure \\nof the Security Council, including an expansion of its \\nmembership. The United States is open to this \\nprospect. We believe that Japan is well qualified for \\npermanent membership on the Security Council and \\nthat other nations should be considered as well. The \\nUnited States will listen to all good ideas, and we will \\nsupport changes to the Security Council as part of \\nbroader United Nations reform. And in all we do, I call \\non Member States to work for an institution that \\nadheres to strict ethical standards and lives up to the \\nhigh principles of the Universal Declaration. \\n With the commitment and courage of those in this \\nHall, we can build a world where people are free to \\nspeak, assemble and worship as they wish   a world \\nwhere children in every nation grow up healthy, get a \\ndecent education and look to the future with hope   a \\nworld where opportunity crosses every border. America \\nwill lead towards that vision, in which all are created \\nequal and free to pursue their dreams. That is the \\nfounding conviction of my country. It is the promise \\nthat established this body. And, with our determination, \\nit can be the future of our world.  \\n</td>\n","      <td>15483</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>6143</th>\n","      <td>63</td>\n","      <td>2008</td>\n","      <td>USA</td>\n","      <td>United States</td>\n","      <td>George W.

Sixty-three years ago, \\nrepresentatives from around the world gathered in San \\nFrancisco to complete the founding of the Charter of \\nthe United Nations. They met in the shadow of a \\ndevastating war, with grave new dangers on the \\nhorizon. They agreed on a historic pledge to reaffirm \\nfaith in fundamental human rights and unite their \\nstrength to maintain international peace and security. \\nThat noble pledge has endured trying hours in United \\nNations history, and it still guides our work today.  \\n \\n \\n9 08-51570 \\n \\n Yet the ideals of the Charter are now facing a \\nchallenge as serious as any since the United Nations \\nfounding: a global movement of violent extremists. By \\ndeliberately murdering the innocent to advance their \\naims, those extremists defy the fundamental principles \\nof international order. They show contempt for all who \\nrespect life and value human dignity. They reject the \\nwords of the Bible, the Koran, the Torah or any \\nstandard of conscience of morality. They imperil the \\nvalues of justice and human rights that gave birth to the \\nUnited Nations — values that have fuelled an \\nunprecedented expansion of freedom across the world.  \\n To uphold the words of the Charter in the face of \\nthis challenge, every nation in this Hall has \\nresponsibilities. As sovereign States, we have an \\nobligation to govern responsibly and solve problems \\nbefore they spill across borders. We have an obligation \\nto prevent our territory from being used as a sanctuary \\nfor terrorism, proliferation, human trafficking and \\norganized crime. We have an obligation to respect the \\nrights and respond to the needs of our people.  \\n Multilateral organizations have responsibilities. \\nFor eight years, the nations in this Assembly have \\nworked together to confront the extremist threat. We \\nhave witnessed successes and setbacks, and through it \\nall a clear lesson has emerged. The United Nations and \\nother multilateral organizations are needed more \\nurgently than ever. To be successful, we must be \\nfocused, resolute and effective.  \\n Instead of only adopting resolutions decrying \\nterrorist acts after they occur, we must cooperate more \\nclosely to keep terrorist attacks from happening in the \\nfirst place. Instead of treating all forms of Government \\nas equally tolerable, we must actively challenge the \\nconditions of tyranny and despair that allow terror and \\nextremists to thrive. By acting together to meet the \\nfundamental challenge of our time, we can lead \\ntowards a world that is more secure, more prosperous \\nand more hopeful.  \\n In the decades ahead, the United Nations and \\nother multilateral organizations must continually \\nconfront terror. That mission requires clarity of vision. \\nWe must see the terrorists for what they are: ruthless \\nextremists who exploit the desperate, subvert the tenets \\nof a great religion and seek to impose their will on as \\nmany people as possible. Some suggest that those men \\nwould pose less of a threat if we would only leave \\nthem alone, yet their leaders make clear that no \\nconcession could ever satisfy their ambitions. Bringing \\nthe terrorists to justice does not create terrorism. It is \\nthe best way to protect our people.  \\n Multilateral organizations must respond by taking \\nan unequivocal moral stand against terrorism. No cause \\ncan justify the deliberate taking of innocent life, and \\nthe international community is nearing universal \\nagreement on this truth. The vast majority of nations in \\nthis Assembly now agree that tactics like suicide \\nbombing, hostage-taking and hijacking are never \\nlegitimate. The Security Council has adopted \\nresolutions declaring terror unlawful and requiring all \\nnations to crack down on terrorist financing. Earlier \\nthis month, the Secretary-General held a conference to \\nhighlight victims of terror, where he stated that \\nterrorism can never be justified. \\n Other multilateral organizations have spoken \\nclearly as well. The Group of 8 has declared that all \\nterrorist acts are criminal and must be universally \\ncondemned. The Secretary-General of the Organization \\nof the Islamic Conference recently spoke out against \\nsuicide bombing, which he said runs counter to the \\nteachings of Islam.  \\n The message behind those statements is \\nresolutely clear. Like slavery and piracy, terrorism has \\nno place in the modern world. Around the globe, \\nnations are turning those words into action. Members \\nof the United Nations are sharing intelligence with one \\nanother, conducting joint operations and freezing \\nterrorists’ finances. While terrorists continue to carry \\nout attacks like the terrible bombing in Islamabad last \\nweek, our joint actions have spared our citizens from \\nmany devastating blows.  \\n The brutal nature of the extremists is increasingly \\nclear and the coalition of nations confronting terrorists \\nis growing stronger. Over the past seven years, \\nAfghanistan and Iraq have been transformed from \\nregimes that actively sponsor terror to democracies that \\nfight terror. Libya has renounced its support for terror \\nand its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Nations like Saudi \\nArabia and Pakistan are actively pursuing the terrorists. \\nA few nations, regimes like Syria and Iran, continue to \\nsponsor terror, yet their numbers are growing fewer \\nand they are growing more isolated from the world.  \\n As the twenty-first century unfolds, some may be \\ntempted to assume that the threat has receded. That \\nwould be comforting. It would be wrong. The terrorists \\nbelieve time is on their side, so they have made waiting \\n  \\n \\n08-51570 10 \\n \\nout civilized nations part of their strategy. We must not \\nallow them to succeed. The nations of this body must \\nstand united in the fight against terror. We must \\ncontinue working to deny the terrorists refuge \\nanywhere in the world, including ungoverned spaces. \\nWe must remain vigilant against proliferation by fully \\nimplementing the terms of resolution 1540 (2004) and \\nenforcing sanctions against North Korea and Iran. We \\nmust not relent until our people are safe from this \\nthreat to civilization. \\n To uphold the Charter’s promise of peace and \\nsecurity in the twenty-first century, we must also \\nconfront the ideology of the terrorists. At its core, the \\nstruggle against extremists is a battle of ideas. \\nTerrorists envision a world in which religious freedom \\nis denied, women are oppressed and all dissent is \\ncrushed. The nations represented in this Hall must \\npresent a more hopeful alternative — a vision where \\npeople can speak freely, worship as they choose and \\npursue their dreams in liberty.  \\n Advancing this vision of freedom serves our \\nhighest ideals, as expressed in the United Nations \\nCharter’s commitment to the dignity and worth of the \\nhuman person. Advancing this vision also serves our \\nsecurity interests. History shows that when citizens \\nhave a voice in choosing their own leaders, they are \\nless likely to search for meaning in radical ideologies, \\nand when Governments respect the rights of their \\npeople, they are more likely to respect the rights of \\ntheir neighbours. \\n For all these reasons, the nations of this body \\nmust challenge tyranny as vigorously as we challenge \\nterror. Some question whether people in certain parts of \\nthe world actually desire freedom. This self-serving \\ncondescension has been disproved before our eyes. \\nFrom the voting booths of Afghanistan, Iraq and \\nLiberia to the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, the Rose \\nRevolution in Georgia, the Cedar Revolution in \\nLebanon and the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan, we \\nhave seen people consistently make the courageous \\ndecision to demand their liberty. \\n For all the suggestions to the contrary, the truth is \\nthat, whenever and wherever people are given the \\nchoice, they choose freedom. Nations represented in \\nthis Hall have supported the efforts of dissidents, \\nreformers and civil society advocates in newly free \\nsocieties through the new United Nations Democracy \\nFund, and we appreciate those efforts. As young \\ndemocracies around the world continue to make brave \\nstands for liberty, multilateral organizations like the \\nUnited Nations must continue to stand with them. \\n In Afghanistan, a determined people are working \\nto overcome decades of tyranny and protect their newly \\nfree society. They have strong support from all 26 \\nnations of the NATO alliance. I appreciate the United \\nNations decision this week to renew the mandate of the \\nInternational Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. \\nThe United Nations also has an active civilian presence \\nin Afghanistan, where experts are doing important \\nwork helping to improve education, facilitate \\nhumanitarian aid and protect human rights. We must \\ncontinue to help the Afghan people defend their young \\ndemocracy so that the Taliban does not return to power \\nand Afghanistan is never again a safe haven for terror. \\n In Iraq, the fight has been difficult, yet daily life \\nhas improved dramatically over the past 20 months \\nthanks to the courage of the Iraqi people, a determined \\ncoalition of nations and a surge of American troops. \\nThe United Nations has provided the mandate for \\nmultinational forces in Iraq through this December, and \\nthe United Nations is carrying out an ambitious \\nstrategy to strengthen Iraq’s democracy, including \\nhelping Iraqis prepare for their next round of free \\nelections. Whatever disagreements our nations have \\nhad on Iraq, we should all welcome this progress \\ntowards stability and peace and we should stand united \\nin helping Iraq’s democracy succeed.  \\n We must stand united in our support of other \\nyoung democracies, from the people of Lebanon \\nstruggling to maintain their hard-won independence to \\nthe people of the Palestinian territories, who deserve a \\nfree and peaceful State of their own. We must stand \\nunited in our support of the people of Georgia. The \\nUnited Nations Charter sets forth the equal rights of \\nnations large and small; Russia’s invasion of Georgia \\nwas a violation of those rights. Young democracies \\naround the world are watching to see how we respond \\nto this test. The United States has worked with allies in \\nsuch multilateral institutions as the European Union \\nand NATO to uphold Georgia’s territorial integrity and \\nprovide humanitarian relief. Our nations will continue \\nto support Georgia’s democracy. \\n In this Hall are representatives of Georgia, \\nUkraine, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Liberia, Iraq and other \\nbrave young democracies. We admire their courage, we \\nhonour their sacrifices, and we thank them for their \\n \\n \\n11 08-51570 \\n \\ninspiring example. We will continue to stand with all \\nwho stand for freedom. This noble goal is worthy of \\nthe United Nations and it should have the support of \\nevery member of this Assembly.  \\n Extending the reach of political freedom is \\nessential to prevailing in the great struggle of our time, \\nbut it is not enough. Many in this Hall have answered \\nthe call to help their brothers and sisters in need by \\nworking to alleviate hopelessness. Those efforts to \\nimprove the human condition honour the highest ideals \\nof this institution. They also advance our security \\ninterests. The extremists find their most fertile \\nrecruiting grounds in societies trapped in chaos and \\ndespair — places where people see no prospect of a \\nbetter life. In the shadows of hopelessness, radicalism \\nthrives. Eventually, that radicalism can boil over into \\nviolence, cross borders and take innocent lives across \\nthe world.  \\n Overcoming hopelessness requires addressing its \\ncauses: poverty, disease and ignorance. Challenging \\nthese conditions is in the interest of every nation in this \\nHall, and democracies are particularly well positioned \\nto carry out that work because we have experience \\nresponding to the needs of our own people. We are \\nnatural partners in helping other nations respond to the \\nneeds of theirs. Together, we must commit our \\nresources and efforts to advancing education, health \\nand prosperity.  \\n Over the years, many nations have made well-\\nintentioned efforts to promote these goals, but the \\nsuccess of these efforts must be measured by more than \\nintentions. It must be measured by results. My nation is \\nplacing insistence on results at the heart of our foreign \\nassistance programmes. We launched a new initiative, \\ncalled the Millennium Challenge Account, which \\ndirects our help to countries that demonstrate their \\nability to produce results by governing justly, fighting \\ncorruption and pursuing market-based economic \\npolicies, as well as investing in their people. Every \\ncountry and institution that provides foreign assistance, \\nincluding the United Nations, will be more effective by \\nshowing faith in the people of the developing world \\nand insisting on performance in return for aid.  \\n Experience also shows that, to be effective, we \\nmust adopt a model of partnership, not paternalism. \\nThis approach is based on our conviction that people in \\nthe developing world have the capacity to improve \\ntheir own lives and will rise to meet high expectations \\nif we set them. America sought to apply this model in \\nour Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Every nation that \\nreceives American support through this initiative \\ndevelops its own plan for fighting HIV/AIDS and \\nmeasures the results.  \\n So far, these results are inspiring. Five years ago, \\n50,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving \\ntreatment for HIV/AIDS; today, that number is nearly \\n1.7 million. We are taking a similar approach to \\nfighting malaria, and so far we have supported local \\nefforts to protect more than 25 million Africans. \\nMultilateral organizations have made bold \\ncommitments of their own to fight disease. The G-8 \\nhas pledged to match America’s efforts on malaria and \\nHIV/AIDS. Through the Global Fund, many countries \\nare working to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria and \\ntuberculosis. Lives in the developing world depend on \\nthese programmes, and all who have made pledges to \\nfight disease have an obligation to follow through on \\ntheir commitments.  \\n One of the most powerful engines of development \\nand prosperity are trade and investment, which create \\nnew opportunities for entrepreneurs, help people rise \\nout of poverty and reinforce such fundamental values \\nas transparency and the rule of law. For all these \\nreasons, many represented in this Hall have conducted \\nfree-trade agreements at the bilateral and regional \\nlevels.  \\n The most effective step of all would be an \\nagreement that tears down trade barriers at the global \\nlevel. The recent impasse in the Doha round is \\ndisappointing, but that does not have to be the final \\nword. I urge every nation to seize this opportunity to \\nlift up economies around the world and reach a \\nsuccessful Doha agreement as soon as possible. \\nBeyond Doha, our nations must renew our commitment \\nto open economies and stand firm against economic \\nisolationism. These objectives are being tested by \\nturbulence in the global financial markets.  \\n Our economies are more closely connected than \\never before, and I know that many of you here are \\nwatching how the United States Government will \\naddress the problems in our financial system. In recent \\nweeks we have taken bold steps to prevent a severe \\ndisruption of the American economy, which would \\nhave a devastating effect on other economies around \\nthe world. We promote stability in the markets by \\npreventing the disorderly failure of major companies. \\n  \\n \\n08-51570 12 \\n \\nThe Federal Reserve has injected urgently needed \\nliquidity into the system. Last week, I announced \\ndecisive action by the federal Government to address \\nthe root cause of much of the instability in our \\nfinancial markets by purchasing illiquid assets that are \\nweighing down balance sheets and restricting the flow \\nof credit. I can assure the Assembly that my \\nAdministration and our Congress are working together \\nto quickly pass legislation approving this strategy. And \\nI am confident that we will act in the urgent time frame \\nrequired.  \\n The objectives I have laid out for multilateral \\ninstitutions confronting terror, opposing tyranny and \\npromoting effective development are difficult, but they \\nare necessary tasks. To have maximum impact, \\nmultilateral institutions must take on challenging \\nmissions, and like all of us in this Hall they must work \\ntowards measurable goals, be accountable for their \\nactions and hold true to their word.  \\n In the twenty-first century, the world needs a \\ncompetent and effective United Nations. This unique \\ninstitution should build on its successes and improve \\nits performance. Where there is inefficiency and \\ncorruption, that must be corrected. Where there are \\nbloated bureaucracies, they must be streamlined. \\nWhere Members fail to uphold their obligations, there \\nmust be strong action — for example, there should be \\nan immediate review of the Human Rights Council, \\nwhich has routinely protected violators of human \\nrights. There should be a stronger effort to help the \\npeople of Burma live free of the repression they have \\nsuffered for too long. All nations, especially members \\nof the Security Council, must act decisively to ensure \\nthat the Government of the Sudan upholds its \\ncommitment to address the violence in Darfur. \\n The United Nations is an Organization of \\nextraordinary potential. As it rebuilds its Headquarters, \\nit must also open the door to a new age of \\ntransparency, accountability and seriousness of \\npurpose. With determination and clear purpose, the \\nUnited Nations can be a powerful force for good as we \\nhead into the twenty-first century. It can affirm the \\ngreat promise of its founding.  \\n In the final days of the San Francisco Conference, \\nthe delegates negotiating the United Nations Charter \\nreceived a visit from President Harry Truman. He \\nacknowledged the enormous challenges they faced and \\nsaid that success was possible only because of what he \\ncalled an unshakable unity of determination. Today, the \\nworld is engaged in another period of great challenge, \\nand by continuing to work together, that unshakable \\nunity of determination will be ours. Together we can \\nconfront and defeat the evil of terrorism. Together we \\ncan secure the Almighty’s gift of liberty and justice to \\nmillions who have not known it. Together we can build \\na world that is freer, safer and better for the \\ngenerations who follow.</td>\n","      <td>18384</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["      session  year country   country_name             speaker   position  \\\n","2720  44       1989  USA     United States  Bush                President   \n","3038  46       1991  USA     United States  George Bush         President   \n","4814  56       2001  USA     United States  George W.

General Assembly today at the beginning of its forty-fourth session. I should like to congratulate Joseph Garba of Nigeria, a distinguished diplomat, on his election as President of this session of the General Assembly, and I wish him success in his presidency.\\nI feel a great personal pleasure on this occasion, for this is a homecoming for both Barbara and me. The memories of my time here in 1971 and 1972 are still with me today - the human moments, the humorous moments that are part of even the highest undertaking.\\nWith the Assembly's permission, I should like to share one story from one of the many meetings of the Security Council. I was the Permanent Representative of the United States, and I was 45 minutes late for the meeting. All 45 minutes were filled by the first speaker to take the floor, and when I walked in and took my seat the speaker paused, with great courtesy, and said: 'I welcome the Permanent Representative of the United States. And now, for his benefit, I will start my speech all over again, from the beginning.'\\nThat is a true story, at that moment. differences of alliance and ideology didn't matter. The universal groan that went up around that table from every representative present, and the laughter that followed united us all. Today, I would like to begin by recognising - again, a personal privilege - the current Permanent Representatives with whom I served, Ambassador Dugersuren, Ambassador Martinez Ordonez. Ambassador Pabetafika and Permanent Observer Dube. It is wonderful to look around and see so any familiar faces - foreign ministers, members of the Secretariat, and delegates. Of course, the Secretary-General, you were the Permanent representative of your country when we served together. Under-Secretary-General Farah. you were a Permanent Representative back then too. Ambassador Aguilar was here then and is now back. It is an honour to be back with you in this historic Hall, and I apologize if , have forgotten any of you old enough to have served in 1971 and 1972.\\n\\nThe United Nations was established forty-four years ago upon the ashes of war and amidst great hopes. The UN can do great things. No, the United Nations is not perfect, it is not a panacea for the world's problem. But it is a vital forum where the nations of the world seek to replace conflict with consensus, and it must remain a forum for peace. The UN has the support of the United States of America. In recent years, the war of words that is often echoed in this Hall has been giving way to a new mood. \\nWe have seen a welcome shift from polemics to peace-keeping. United Nations Peace-keepers have given their lives in service to the United Nations. Today, should like to remember one of those soldiers of peace, an American on a mission of peace under the United Nations flag, on a mission for all the world, a man of unquestioned bravery and unswerving, dedication to the United Nations ideal - Lieutenant-Colonel William Richard Higgins. I call on the General Assembly to condemn the murder of this soldier of peace and to call on those responsible to have the decency to return his remains to his family. Let us all - right now, right here - dedicate ourselves and our nations to the cause that Colonel Higgins served so selflessly.\\nThe founders of this historic institution believed that it was here that the nations of the world might come to agree that law, not force, shall govern. And the United Nations can play a fundamental role in the central issue of our time, for today, there is an idea at work around the globe, an idea of undeniable force - and that idea is freedom. Freedom's advance is evident everywhere.- Central Europe and Hungary, where State and society are now in the midst of a movement towards political pluralism and a free-market economy, where the barrier that once enforced an unnatural division between Hungary and its neighbours to the west has been torn down and replaced by a new hope for the future, a new hope in freedom. We see freedom at work in Poland, where, in deference to the will of the people, the Communist Party has relinquished its monopoly on power, and indeed in the Soviet Union, where the world hears the voices of people no longer afraid to speak out or to assert the right to rule themselves.\\nBut freedom's march is not confined to a single continent or to the developed world alone. We see the rise of freedom in Latin America where, one by one, dictatorships are giving way to democracy. We see it on the continent of Africa, where more and more nations see in the system of free enterprise salvation for economies crippled by excessive State control. East and West, North and South, on every continent, we can see the outlines of a new world of freedom.\\nOf course, freedom's work remains unfinished. The trend we see is not yet universal. Some regimes still stand against the tide. Some rulers still deny the right of the people to govern themselves. But now the power of prejudice and despotism is challenged. Never before have these regimes stood so isolated and alone, so out of step with the steady advance of freedom. Today we are witnessing an ideological collapse, the demise of the totalitarian idea of the omniscient, all-powerful State. There are many reasons for this collapse, but in the end one fact alone explains what we see today: advocates of the totalitarian idea saw its triumph written in the laws of history, they failed to see the love of freedom that was written in the human heart.\\nTwo hundred years ago today, the United States - our Congress - proposed the Bill of Rights: fundamental freedoms belonging to every individual. Rights no Government can deny. Those same rights have been recognized in this congress of nations in the words of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations. From where we stand, on the threshold of this new world of freedom, the trend is clear enough. If, for those who write the history of our times, the twentieth century is remembered as the century of the state, the twenty-first century must be an era of emancipation, the age of the individual. Make no mistake, nothing can stand in the way of freedom's march. There will come a day when freedom is seen the world over to be the universal birthright of every man and woman, of every race and walk of life. Even under the worst circumstances, at the darkest of times, freedom has always remained alive - a distant dream, perhaps, but always alive.\\nToday, that dream is no longer distant. For the first time, for millions around the world, a new world of freedom is within reach. Today is freedom's moment. You see, the possibility now exists for the creation of a true community of nations, built on shared interests and ideals. A true community, a world where free Governments and free markets meet the rising desire of the people to control their own destiny, to live in dignity, and to exercise freely their fundamental human rights. It is time that worked together to deliver that destiny into the hands of men and women everywhere. Our challenge is to strengthen the foundations of freedom, encourage its advance and face our most urgent challenges, the global challenges of the twenty-first century: economic, health, environmental well-being, the great questions of war and peace.\\nFirst, global economic growth. During this decade, a number of developing nations have moved into the ranks of the world's most advanced economies, all of them - each and every one - powered by the engine of free enterprise. In the decade ahead, others can join their ranks, but for many nations, barriers stand in the way. In the case of some countries, these are obstacles of their own making: un-needed restrictions, regulations that act as dead weights on their own economies and obstacles to foreign trade. But other barriers to growth exist, and those, too, require effective action.\\nToo many developing countries struggle today under a burden of debt that makes growth all but impossible. The nations of the world deserve better opportunity to achieve a measure of control over their own economic fate and build better lives for their own people. The approach the United States has put forward - the Brady plan - will help these nations reduce that debt and, at the same time, encourage the free market reforms that will fuel economic growth.\\nIn just two days, I will be speaking to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and I will discuss there, in more detail, the steps that our nations can take in dealing with the debt problem. But I can say now the new world of freedom is not a world where a few nations live in comfort while others live in want. The power of commerce is a force for progress. Open markets are the key to continued growth in the developing world. Today, the United States buys over one-half of the global manufactured exports that all developing nations combined sell to the industrialized world. It is time for the other advanced economies to follow suit, to create expanded opportunities for trade. I believe we will learn, in the century ahead, that many nations of the world have barely begun to tap their true potential for development. The free market and its fruits are not the special preserve of a few, they are a harvest that everyone can share.\\nBeyond the challenge of global growth lies another issue of global magnitude: the environment. No line drawn on a map can stop the advance of pollution. Threats to our environment have become international problems. We must develop an international approach to urgent environmental issues, one that seeks common solutions to common problems. The United Nations is already at work on the question of global warming and the effort to prevent oil spills and other disasters from fouling our seas and the air we breathe. And I will tell you now the United States will do its part. We have committed ourselves to the world-wide phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons by the year 2000. We have proposed amending our own Clean Air Act to ensure clean air for our citizens within a single generation. We have banned the import of ivory to protect the elephant and rhinoceros from the human predators who exterminate them for profit. And we have begun to explore ways to work with other nations, with the major industrialized democracies, and in Poland and in Hungary, to make common cause for the sake of our environment.\\nThe environment belongs to all of us. In this new world of freedom, the world's citizens must enjoy this common trust for generations to come. Global economic growth and the stewardship of our planet - both are critical issues.\\nBut as always, questions of war and peace must be paramount to the United Nations. We must move forward to limit and eliminate weapons of mass destruction. Five years ago, at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, I presented a United States draft treaty outlawing chemical weapons. Since then, progress has been made, but time is running out. The threat is growing. More than 20 nations now possess chemical weapons or the capability to produce them. And these horrible weapons are now finding their way into regional conflicts. That is simply unacceptable. For the sake of mankind, we must halt and reverse this threat.\\nToday I want to announce steps that the United States is ready to take, steps to rid the world of these truly terrible weapons, steps towards a treaty that will ban - eliminate - all chemical weapons from the Earth 10 years from the day it is signed. This initiative contains three major elements. First, in the first eight years of a chemical weapons treaty the United States is ready to destroy nearly all - 98 per cent - of our chemical weapons stockpile, provided the Soviet Union joins the ban, and I think it will. Secondly, we are ready to destroy all of our chemical weapons - 100 per cent, every one - within 10 years, once all nations capable of building chemical weapons sign that total-ban treaty. And thirdly, the United States is ready to begin now. We will eliminate more than 80 per cent of our stockpile even as we work to complete a treaty, if the Soviet Union joins us in cutting chemical weapons to an equal level and if we agree on the conditions, including inspections, under which stockpiles are destroyed.\\nWe know that monitoring a total ban on chemical weapons will be a challenge. But the knowledge we have gained from our recent arms control experience and our accelerating research in this area makes me believe that we can achieve the level of verification that gives us confidence to go forward with the ban. The world has lived too long in the shadow of chemical warfare? so let us act together, beginning today, to rid the Earth of this scourge.\\nWe are serious about achieving conventional arms reductions as well. And that is why we put forward new proposals just last Thursday at the negotiations in Vienna on conventional forces in Europe, proposals that demonstrate our commitment to act rapidly to ease military tensions in Europe and move the nations of that continent one step closer to their common destiny: a Europe whole and free.\\nThe United States is convinced that open and innovative measures can move disarmament forward and also ease international tensions. That is the idea behind the 'open skies' proposal, about which the Soviets have now expressed a positive attitude. It is the idea behind the 'open lands' proposal, permitting for the first time ever free travel for all Soviet and United States diplomats throughout each other's countries. Openness is the enemy of mistrust, and every step towards a more open world is a step towards the new world we seek.\\nLet me make this comment on our meetings with the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, Mr. Shevardnadze, over the past few days: I am very pleased by the progress made. The Soviet Union removed a number of obstacles to progress on conventional and strategic arms reductions. We reached agreements in principle on issues from verification to nuclear testing. And, of course, we agreed to a summit in the spring or early summer of 1990. I look forward to meeting Mr. Gorbachev there.\\nEach of those achievements is important in its own right, but they are more important still as signs of a new attitude that prevails between the United States and the USSR. Serious differences remain; we know that. But the willingness to deal constructively and candidly with those differences is news that we and indeed the world must welcome. We have not entered into an era of perpetual peace. The threats to peace that nations face may today be changing, but they have not vanished. In fact, in a number of regions around the world, a dangerous combination is now emerging: regimes armed with old and unappeasable animosities and modern weapons of mass destruction. That development will raise the stakes whenever war breaks out. Regional conflict may well threaten world peace as never before.\\nThe challenge of preserving peace is a personal one for all individuals right here in this Hall. Mr. Secretary-General, I say with great respect that you have made it your own. The United Nations can be a mediator, a forum where parties in conflict come in search of peaceful solutions. For the sake of peace, the United Nations must redouble its support for the peace efforts now under way in regions of conflict all over the world. I assure the Assembly that the United States is determined to take an active role in settling regional conflicts. Sometimes our role in regional disputes is and will be highly public, and sometimes, like many others do, we work quietly behind the scenes. But always, we are working for positive change and lasting peace.\\nOur world faces other, less conventional threats no less dangerous to international peace and stability. Illegal drugs are a menace to social order and a source of human misery wherever they gain a foothold. The nations which suffer this scourge must join forces in the fight, and we are. Let me salute the commitment and extraordinary courage of one country in particular: Colombia, where\\nwe are working with the people and their President, Virgil lo Barco, to put the drug cartels cut of business and bring the drug lords to justice.\\nFinally, we must join forces to combat the threat of terrorism. Every nation and the United Nations must send the outlaws of the world a clear message hostage-taking and the terror of random violence are methods that cannot win the world's approval. Terrorism of any kind is repugnant to all values that a civilized world holds in common. And make no mistake.- Terrorism is a means that no end, no matter how just, can sanctify.\\nWhatever the challenge, freedom greatly raises the chances of our success. Freedom's moment is a time for hope for all of the world, because freedom, once set in motion, takes on a momentum of its own. As I said the day I assumed the presidency of our country, we do not have to talk late into the night about which form of government is better. We know that free government, democracy, is best. And I believe that is the hard-won truth of our time, the unassailable fact that still stands at the end of a century of great struggle and human suffering. And this is true not because all our differences must give way to democracy , but because democracy makes room for all our differences. In democracy, diversity finds its common home.\\nAt the very heart of the democratic ideal is respect for freedom of belief, freedom of thought and action, in all its diversity, for human rights. The world has experienced enough of the ideologies that have promised to remake man in some new and better image. We have seen the colossal tragedies and dashed hopes. We know now that freedom and democracy hold the answers: what men and nations want is the freedom to live by their own lights and a chance to prosper, in peace.\\nWhen I began today I spoke to you about peace-keeping. I want to speak to you now about peace-making. We must bring peace to the people who have never known its blessings. There is a painting that hangs on the wall of my office in the White House which pictures President Abraham Lincoln and his generals meeting near the end of a war that remains the bloodiest in the history of my country. Outside at that moment a battle rages, in this picture, and yet what we see in the distance is a rainbow, a symbol of hope, of the passing of the storm. That painting is called 'The Peace-makers'. For me, it is a constant reminder that our struggle, the struggle for peace, is a struggle blessed by hope.\\nI do remember sitting in this Hall, I remember the mutual respect among all of us proudly serving as representatives, yes, I remember the almost endless speeches - and I do not want this to be one of them - the Security Council sessions, the receptions, those long receiving lines, the formal meetings of the General Assembly, and the informal discussions in the delegates' lounge. And I remember something more, something beyond the frantic pace and sometimes frustrating experiences of daily life here: The heartbeat of the United Nations, the quiet conviction that we could make the world more peaceful, more free. What we sought then, all of us, now lies within our reach. I ask each of you here in this Hall:\\nCan we not bring a unity of purpose to the United Nations? Can we not make this new world of freedom the common destiny we seek? I believe we can. I know we must. My solemn wish today is that here, among the United Nations, that spirit will take hold, and that all men and all nations will make freedom's moment their own.\\nThank you, God bless you, and may God bless the work of the United Nations.  \\n   \n","3038  ﻿I am honoured to speak with you as you open the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I should first like to congratulate the outgoing President, Guido de Marco of Malta, and salute our incoming President, Samir Al-Shihabi of Saudi Arabia.\\nI also want to salute especially Secretary-General Javier Peres de Cuellar, who will step down in just over three months. But let me say, Secretary-General Peres de Cuellar has served with great distinction during a period of unprecedented change and turmoil, and for almost 10 years we have enjoyed the leadership of this man of peace, a man that I, along with many Members, feel proud to call friend, and so today let us congratulate our friend and praise his spectacular service to the United Nations and to the people of the world, the Secretary-General.\\nLet me also welcome new Members in this Hall, two delegations representing Korea, particularly our democratic friends, the Republic of Korea, the Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and new missions from the Marshall Islands and Micronesia. Twenty years ago, when I was the Permanent Representative here for the United States, there were 132 United Nations Members. Just one week ago, 159 nations enjoyed membership in the United Nations, and today the number stands at 166. The presence of these new Members alone provides reason for us to celebrate. \\nMy statement today will not sound like any you have heard from a President of the United States. I am not going to dwell on the super-Power competition that defined international politics for half a century. Instead, I will discuss the challenges of building peace and prosperity in a world leavened by the cold war's end and the resumption of history.\\nCommunism held history captive for years. It suspended ancient disputes; and it suppressed ethnic rivalries, nationalist aspirations and old prejudices. As it has dissolved, suspended hatreds have sprung to life. People who for years have been denied their pasts, have begun searching for their own identities, often through peaceful and constructive means, occasionally through factionalism and bloodshed.\\nThis revival of history ushers in a new era teeming with opportunities and perils. Let us begin by discussing the opportunities. First, history's renewal enables people to pursue their natural instincts for enterprise. Communism froze that progress until its failures became too much for even its defenders to bear, and now citizens throughout the world have chosen enterprise over envy, personal responsibility over the enticements of the State, prosperity over the poverty of central planning.\\nThe United Nations Charter encourages this adventure by pledging to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples, and I can think of no better way to fulfil this Mission than to promote the free flow of goods and Ideas, frankly, ideas and goods will travel around the globe with or without our help. The information revolution has destroyed the weapons of enforced isolation and ignorance. In many parts of the world technology has overwhelmed tyranny, proving that the age of Information can become the age of liberation, if we limit State power wisely and free our people to make the best use of new ideas, inventions and insights. By the same token, the world has learned that free markets provide levels of prosperity, growth and happiness that centrally planned economies can never offer.\\nEven the most charitable estimates indicate that in recent years the free world's economies have grown at twice the rate of the former communist world. Growth does more than fill shelves; it permits every person to gain, not at the expense of others but to the benefit of others. Prosperity encourages people to live as neighbours, not as predators. Economic growth can aid international relations in exactly the same way.\\nMany nations represented here are parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The Uruguay Round, the latest in the post-war series of trade negotiations, offers hope to developing nations, many of which have been cruelly divided, cruelly deceived, by the false promises of totalitarianism. Here in this Hall, we hear about North-South problems. But free and open trade, including unfettered access to markets and credit, offers developing countries means of self-sufficiency and economic dignity.\\nIf the Uruguay Round should fail, a new wave of protectionism could destroy our hopes for a better future. History shows all too clearly that protectionism can destroy wealth within countries and poison relations between them. Therefore, I call upon all members of GATT to redouble their efforts to reach a successful conclusion for the Uruguay Round. I pledge that the United States will do its part.\\nI cannot stress this enough: Economic progress will play a vital role In the new world. It supplies the soil in which democracy grows best. People everywhere seek government of and by the people, and they want to enjoy their inalienable rights to freedom and property and person. Challenges to democracy have failed. Just last month, coup plotters in the Soviet Union tried to derail the forces of liberty and reform, but Soviet citizens refused to follow. Most of the nations in this Hall stood with the forces of reform led by Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, and against the coup plotters.\\nThe challenge facing the Soviet peoples now, that of building political systems based upon individual liberty, minority rights, democracy and free markets, mirrors every nation's responsibility for encouraging peaceful, democratic reform, but it also testifies to the extraordinary power of the democratic ideal. As democracy flourishes, so does the opportunity (or a third historical breakthrough, international cooperation. A year ago, the Soviet Union joined the United States and a host of other nations in defending a tiny country against aggression and opposing Saddam Hussein. For the very first time on a matter of major importance super-Power competition was replaced with international cooperation. The United Nations, in one of its finest moments, constructed a measured, principled, deliberate and courageous response to Saddam Hussein. It stood up to an outlaw who invaded Kuwait, who threatened many States within the region, who sought to set a menacing precedent for the post-cold-war world.\\nThe coalition effort established a model for the collective settlement of disputes. Members sat the goal - the liberation of Kuwait - and devised a courageous, unified means of achieving that goal. Mow, for the first time, we have a real chance to fulfil the United Nations Charter's ambition of working 'to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war ... to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small ... to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom'. Those are the words of the Charter.\\nHe will not revive these ideals if we fail to acknowledge the challenge that the renewal of history presents. In Europe and Asia, nationalist passions have flared anew, challenging borders, straining the fabric of international society. At the same time, around the world many age-old conflicts still fester. We see signs of this tumult right here. The United Nations has mounted more peace-keeping missions in the last 36 months than during its first 43 years, and although we now seem mercifully liberated from the fear of nuclear holocaust, these smaller, virulent conflicts should trouble us all.\\nWe must face this challenge squarely - first, by pursuing the peaceful resolution of disputes now in progress; secondly, and more importantly, by trying to prevent others from erupting. No one hare can promise that today's borders will remain fixed for all time, but we must strive to ensure the peaceful, negotiated settlement of border disputes.\\nWe must also promote the cause of international harmony by addressing old feuds. We should take seriously the Charter's pledge to practise tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours. United Nations General Assembly resolution 3379 (XXX), the so-called 'Zionism is racism' resolution, mocks this pledge and the principles upon which the United Nations was founded, and I call now for its repeal. Zionism is not a policy; it is the idea that led to the creation of a home for the Jewish people, to the State of Israel, and to equate Zionism with the intolerable sin of racism is to twist history and forget the terrible plight of Jews in the Second World War - and indeed throughout history. To equate Zionism with racism is to reject Israel itself, a Member in good standing of the United Nations. This body cannot claim to seek peace and at the same time challenge Israel's right to exist. By repealing this resolution unconditionally the United Nations will enhance its credibility and serve the cause of peace.\\nAs we work to meet the challenge posed by the resumption of history, we also must defend the Charter's emphasis on inalienable human rights. Government has failed if citizens cannot speak their mind, if they cannot form political parties freely and elect governments without coercion, it they cannot practice their religion freely, if they cannot raise their families in peace, if they cannot enjoy a just return from their labour, if they cannot live fruitful lives and at the end of their days look upon their achievements and their society's, progress with pride. Politicians who talk about democracy and freedom but provide neither eventually will feel the sting of public disapproval and the power of peoples yearning to live free.\\nSome nations still deny their basic rights to the people, and too many voices cry out for freedom. For example, the people of Cuba suffer oppression at the hands of a dictator who has not got the word, the lone hold-out in an otherwise democratic hemisphere, a man who has not adapted to a world that has no use for totalitarian tyranny. Elsewhere, despots ignore the heartening fact that the rest of the world is embarked upon a new age of liberty.\\nThe renewal of history also imposes an obligation to remain vigilant about new threats and old. He must expand our efforts to control nuclear proliferation. We must work to prevent the spread of chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them.\\nIt is for this reason that I put forward my Middle East arms initiative, a comprehensive approach to stop and, where possible, reverse the accumulation of arms in that part of the world moat prone to violence. We must remember that self-interest will tug nations in different directions, and that struggles over perceived interests will flare sometimes into violence. We can never say with confidence where the next conflict may arise. And we cannot promise eternal peace - not while demagogue peddle false promises to people hungry with hope; not while terrorists use our citizens as pawns and drug dealers destroy our peoples. He, as a result, must band together to overwhelm affronts to basic human dignity. It is no longer acceptable to shrug and say that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. Let us put the law above the crude and cowardly practice of hostage-holding.\\nIn a world defined by change, we must be as firm in principle as we are flexible in our response to changing international conditions. That is especially true today of Iraq. Six months after the adoption of Security Council resolutions 687 (1991) and 688 (1991), Saddam continues to rebuild his weapons of mass destruction and to subject the Iraqi people to brutal repression. Saddam's contempt for United Nations resolutions was first demonstrated back in August 1990, and it continues even as I am speaking. His Government refuses to permit unconditional helicopter inspections, and right now is refusing to allow United Nations inspectors to leave inspected premises with documents relating to an Iraqi nuclear weapons programme. It is the view of the United States that we must keep the United Nations sanctions in place as long as he remains in power. This also shows that we cannot compromise for a moment in seeing that Iraq destroys all of its weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. And we will not compromise.\\nThis is not to say - let me be clear on this point - that we should punish the Iraqi people. Let me repeat: our argument has never been with the people of Iraq. It was, and is, with a brutal dictator whose arrogance dishonours the Iraqi people. Security Council resolution 706 (1991) created a responsible mechanism for sending humanitarian relief to innocent Iraqi citizens. He must put that mechanism to work. Ma must not abandon our principled stand against Saddam's aggression. This cooperative effort has liberated Kuwait. Now it can lead to a just government in Iraq. And when it does - when it does - the Iraqi people can look forward to better lives, free at home, free to engage in a world beyond their borders.\\nThe resumption of history also permits the United Nations to resume the important business of promoting the values that I have discussed today. This body can serve as a vehicle through which willing parties can settle old disputes. In the months to come, I look forward to working with Secretary-General Peres de Cuellar and his successor as we pursue peace in such diverse and divided lands as Afghanistan, Cambodia, Cyprus, El Salvador, and Western Sahara. The United Nations can encourage free market development through its international lending and aid institutions. However, it should not dictate the particular forms of government that nations should adopt. It can, and should, encourage the values upon which the Organization was founded. Together, we should insist that nations seeking our acceptance meet standards of human decency.\\nWhere institutions of freedom have lain dormant, the United Nations can offer them new life. These institutions play a crucial role in our quest for a new world order, an order in which no nation must surrender one iota of its own sovereignty, an order characterized by the rule of law rather than the resort to force, the cooperative development of disputes rather than anarchy and bloodshed, and an unstinting belief in human rights.\\nFinally, you may wonder about America's role the new world I have described. Let me assure you, the United States has no intention of striving for a pax americana. However, we will remain engaged. We will not retreat and pull back into isolationism. We will offer friendship and leadership. In short, we seek a pax universalis, built upon shared responsibilities and aspirations.\\nTo all assembled: We have an opportunity to spare our sons and daughters the sins and errors of the past. We can build a future more satisfying than any our world has ever known. The future lies undefined before us, full of promise, littered with peril. We can choose the kind of world we want: one blistered by the fires of war and subjected to the winds of coercion and chance, or one made more peaceful by reflection and choice. Take this challenge seriously. Inspire future generations to praise and venerate you, to say, 'On the ruins of conflict, these brave men and women built an era of peace and understanding. They inaugurated a new world order, an order worth preserving for the ages.'\\nGood luck to each and every one of you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n","4814  ﻿We meet in a Hall devoted to\\npeace; in a city scarred by violence; in a nation\\nawakened to danger; in a world uniting for a long\\nstruggle. Every civilized nation here today is resolved\\nto keep the most basic commitment of civilization. We\\nwill defend ourselves and our future against terror and\\nlawless violence.\\nThe United Nations was founded in this cause. In\\nthe Second World War, we learned that there is no\\nisolation from evil. We affirmed that some crimes are\\nso terrible they offend humanity itself, and we resolved\\nthat the aggressions and ambitions of the wicked must\\nbe opposed early, decisively and collectively, before\\nthey threaten us all.\\nThat evil has returned, and that cause is renewed.\\nA few miles from here, many thousands still lie in a\\ntomb of rubble. Tomorrow, the Secretary-General, the\\nPresident of the General Assembly and I will visit that\\nsite, where the names of every nation and region that\\nlost citizens will be read aloud. If we were to read out\\nthe names of every person who died, it would take\\nmore than three hours.\\nThose names include a citizen of the Gambia,\\nwhose wife spent their fourth wedding anniversary, 12\\nSeptember, searching in vain for her husband. Those\\nnames include a man who supported his wife in\\nMexico, sending home money every week. Those\\nnames include a young Pakistani who prayed towards\\nMecca five times a day and who died that day trying to\\nsave others.\\nThe suffering of 11 September was inflicted on\\npeople of many faiths and many nations. All of the\\nvictims, including Muslims, were killed with equal\\nindifference and equal satisfaction by the terrorist\\nleaders.\\nThe terrorists are violating the tenets of every\\nreligion, including the one they invoke. Last week, the\\nsheikh of Al-Azhar University, the world’s oldest\\nIslamic institution of higher learning, declared that\\nterrorism is a disease and that Islam prohibits killing\\ninnocent civilians. The terrorists call their cause holy,\\nyet they fund it with drug dealing. They encourage\\nmurder and suicide in the name of a great faith that\\nforbids both. They dare to ask God’s blessing as they\\nset out to kill innocent men, women and children. But\\n8\\n\\nthe God of Isaac and Ishmael would never answer such\\na prayer. And a murderer is not a martyr; he is just a\\nmurderer.\\nTime is passing. Yet for the United States of\\nAmerica, there will be no forgetting 11 September. We\\nwill remember every rescuer who died in honour. We\\nwill remember every family that lives in grief. We will\\nremember the fire and ash, the last phone calls, the\\nfunerals of the children.\\nAnd the people of my country will remember\\nthose who have plotted against us. We are learning\\ntheir names. We are coming to know their faces. There\\nis no corner of the Earth distant or dark enough to\\nprotect them. However long it takes, their hour of\\njustice will come.\\nEvery nation has a stake in this cause. As we\\nmeet, the terrorists are planning more murder —\\nperhaps in my country, or perhaps, fellow members, in\\nyours. They kill because they aspire to dominate. They\\nseek to overthrow Governments and to destabilize\\nentire regions. Last week, anticipating this meeting of\\nthe General Assembly, they denounced the United\\nNations; they called our Secretary-General a criminal\\nand they condemned all Arab nations here as traitors to\\nIslam. Few countries meet their exacting standards of\\nbrutality and oppression. Every other country is a\\npotential target.\\nAnd all the world faces the most horrifying\\nprospect of all: those same terrorists are searching for\\nweapons of mass destruction, the tools to turn their\\nhatred into holocaust. They can be expected to use\\nchemical, biological and nuclear weapons the moment\\nthey are capable of doing so. No hint of conscience\\nwould prevent it. That threat cannot be ignored; that\\nthreat cannot be appeased. Civilization itself — the\\ncivilization we share — is threatened. History will\\nrecord our response and will judge or justify every\\nnation in this Hall.\\nThe civilized world is now responding. We act to\\ndefend ourselves and to deliver our children from a\\nfuture of fear. We choose the dignity of life over a\\nculture of death. We choose lawful change and civil\\ndisagreement over coercion, subversion and chaos.\\nThose commitments — hope and order, law and life —\\nunite people across cultures and continents. Upon those\\ncommitments depend all peace and progress. For those\\ncommitments, we are determined to fight.\\nThe United Nations has risen to this\\nresponsibility: on 12 September, these buildings\\nopened for emergency meetings of the General\\nAssembly and of the Security Council. Before the sun\\nhad set, these attacks on the world stood condemned by\\nthe world, and I want to thank you, fellow members,\\nfor that strong and principled stand.\\nI also thank the Arab and Islamic countries that\\nhave condemned terrorist murder. Many of you have\\nseen the destruction of terror in your own lands. The\\nterrorists are increasingly isolated by their own hatred\\nand extremism. They cannot hide behind Islam. The\\nauthors of mass murder and their allies have no place\\nin any culture, and no home in any faith.\\nThe conspiracies of terror are being answered by\\nan expanding global coalition. Not every nation will be\\npart of every action against the enemy. But every\\nnation in our coalition has duties. Those duties can be\\ndemanding, as we in America are learning. We have\\nalready made adjustments in our laws and in our daily\\nlives. We are taking new measures to investigate terror\\nand to protect against threats.\\nThe leaders of all nations must now carefully\\nconsider their responsibilities and their future. Terrorist\\ngroups such as Al Qaeda depend upon the aid or\\nindifference of Governments. They need the support of\\na financial infrastructure and safe havens to train and\\nplan and hide.\\nSome nations want to play their part in the fight\\nagainst terror but tell us they lack the means to enforce\\ntheir laws and control their borders. We stand ready to\\nhelp.\\nSome Governments still turn a blind eye to the\\nterrorists, hoping the threat will pass them by. They are\\nmistaken.\\nAnd some Governments, while pledging to\\nuphold the principles of the United Nations, have cast\\ntheir lot with the terrorists. They support them and\\nharbour them. And they will find that their welcomed\\nguests are parasites that will weaken them and\\neventually consume them. For every regime that\\nsponsors terror there is a price to be paid, and it will be\\npaid. The allies of terror are equally guilty of murder\\nand equally accountable to justice.\\nThe Taliban are now learning that lesson. That\\nregime and the terrorists who support it are now\\nvirtually indistinguishable. Together they promote\\n9\\n\\nterror abroad and impose a reign of terror on the\\nAfghan people. Women are executed in Kabul’s soccer\\nstadium. They can be beaten for wearing socks that are\\ntoo thin. Men are jailed for missing prayer meetings.\\nThe United States, supported by many nations, is\\nbringing justice to the terrorists in Afghanistan. We are\\nmaking progress against military targets — and that is\\nour objective. Unlike the enemy, we seek to minimize,\\nnot maximize, the loss of innocent life. I am proud of\\nthe honourable conduct of the American military. And\\nmy country grieves for all the suffering the Taliban\\nhave brought upon Afghanistan, including the terrible\\nburden of war.\\nThe Afghan people do not deserve their present\\nrulers. Years of Taliban misrule have brought nothing\\nbut misery and starvation. Even before this current\\ncrisis, 4 million Afghans depended on food from the\\nUnited States and other nations, and millions of\\nAfghans were refugees from Taliban oppression.\\nI make this promise to all the victims of that\\nregime: the Taliban’s days of harbouring terrorists, and\\ndealing in heroin, and brutalizing women are drawing\\nto a close. When that regime is gone, the people of\\nAfghanistan will say, with the rest of the world, good\\nriddance.\\nI can promise, too, that America will join the\\nworld in helping the people of Afghanistan rebuild\\ntheir country.\\nMany nations, including mine, are sending food\\nand medicine to help Afghans through the winter.\\nAmerica has airdropped over 1.3 million packages of\\nrations in Afghanistan. Just this week, we airlifted\\n20,000 blankets and over 200 tons of provisions into\\nthe region. We continue to provide humanitarian aid,\\neven while the Taliban try to steal the food we send.\\nMore help, eventually, will be needed. The\\nUnited States will work closely with the United\\nNations and development banks to reconstruct\\nAfghanistan after hostilities there have ceased and the\\nTaliban are no longer in control. And the United States\\nwill work with the United Nations to support a post-\\nTaliban Government that represents all of the Afghan\\npeople.\\nIn this war of terror, each of us must answer for\\nwhat we have done or what we have left undone. After\\ntragedy, there is a time for sympathy and condolence.\\nMy country has been very grateful for both.\\nThe memorials and vigils around the world will\\nnot be forgotten. But the time for sympathy has now\\npassed. The time for action has now arrived.\\nThe most basic obligations in this new conflict\\nhave already been defined by the United Nations. On\\n28 September, the Security Council adopted resolution\\n1373 (2001). Its requirements are clear: every\\nUnited Nations Member has a responsibility to crack\\ndown on terrorist financing. We must pass all necessary\\nlaws in our own countries to allow the confiscation of\\nterrorist assets. We must apply those laws to every\\nfinancial institution in every nation.\\nWe have a responsibility to share intelligence and\\ncoordinate the efforts of law enforcement. If you know\\nsomething, tell us. If we know something, we will tell\\nyou. And when we find the terrorists, we must work\\ntogether to bring them to justice.\\nWe have a responsibility to deny any sanctuary,\\nsafe haven, or transit to terrorists. Every known\\nterrorist camp must be shut down, its operators\\napprehended, and evidence of their arrest presented to\\nthe United Nations.\\nWe have a responsibility to deny weapons to\\nterrorists — and to actively prevent private citizens\\nfrom providing them.\\nThese obligations are urgent, and they are binding\\non every nation with a place in this Hall. Many\\nGovernments are taking these obligations seriously,\\nand my country appreciates it. Yet even beyond\\nresolution 1373 (2001), more is required — and more\\nis expected — of our coalition against terror. We are\\nasking for a comprehensive commitment to this fight.\\nWe must unite in opposing all terrorists, not just\\nsome of them. In this world, there are good causes and\\nbad causes, and we may disagree on where that line is\\ndrawn. Yet there is no such thing as a good terrorist.\\nNo national aspiration, no remembered wrong, can ever\\njustify the deliberate murder of the innocent. Any\\nGovernment that rejects this principle — trying to pick\\nand choose its terrorist friends — will know the\\nconsequences.\\nWe must speak the truth about terror. Let us never\\ntolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the\\nattacks of 11 September — malicious lies that attempt\\nto shift the blame away from the terrorists themselves,\\naway from the guilty. To inflame ethnic hatred is to\\nadvance the cause of terror.\\n10\\n\\nThe war against terror must not serve as an\\nexcuse to persecute ethnic and religious minorities in\\nany country. Innocent people must be allowed to live\\ntheir own lives, by their own customs, under their own\\nreligion. And every nation must have avenues for the\\npeaceful expression of opinion and dissent. When these\\navenues are closed, the temptation to speak through\\nviolence grows.\\nWe must press on with our agenda for peace and\\nprosperity in every land. My country is pledged to\\nencouraging development and expanding trade. My\\ncountry is pledged to investing in education and\\ncombating AIDS and other infectious diseases around\\nthe world. Following 11 September, these pledges are\\neven more important. In our struggle against hateful\\ngroups that exploit poverty and despair, we must offer\\nan alternative of opportunity and hope.\\nThe American Government also stands by its\\ncommitment to a just peace in the Middle East. We are\\nworking towards a day when two States — Israel and\\nPalestine — live peacefully together, within secure and\\nrecognized borders, as called for by the Security\\nCouncil resolutions. We will do all in our power to\\nbring both parties back into negotiations. But peace\\nwill come only when all have sworn off — forever —\\nincitement, violence and terror.\\nFinally, this struggle is a defining moment for the\\nUnited Nations itself — and the world needs its\\nprincipled leadership. It undermines the credibility of\\nthis great institution, for example, when the\\nCommission on Human Rights offers seats to some of\\nthe world’s most persistent violators of human rights.\\nThe United Nations depends, above all, on its moral\\nauthority — and that authority must be preserved.\\nThe steps I have described will not be easy. For\\nall nations, they will require effort. For some nations,\\nthey will require great courage. Yet the cost of inaction\\nis far greater. The only alternative to victory is a\\nnightmare world where every city is a potential killing\\nfield.\\nAs I told the American people, freedom and fear\\nare at war. We face enemies that hate not our policies,\\nbut our existence — the tolerance of openness and the\\ncreative culture that define us. But the outcome of this\\nconflict is certain.\\nThere is a current in history, and it runs towards\\nfreedom. Our enemies resent it and dismiss it, but the\\ndreams of mankind are defined by liberty — the natural\\nright to create, and build, and worship, and live in\\ndignity. When men and women are released from\\noppression and isolation, they find fulfilment and hope,\\nand they leave poverty by the millions. These\\naspirations are lifting up the peoples of Europe, Asia,\\nAfrica and the Americas, and they can lift up all of the\\nIslamic world. We stand for the permanent hopes of\\nhumanity, and those hopes will not be denied.\\nWe are confident, too, that history has an author,\\nwho fills time and eternity with his purpose. We know\\nthat evil is real, but good will prevail against it. This is\\nthe teaching of many faiths. And in that assurance, we\\ngain strength for a long journey.\\nIt is our task — the task of this generation — to\\nprovide the response to aggression and terror. We have\\nno other choice, because there is no other peace. We\\ndid not ask for this mission, yet there is honour in\\nhistory’s call. We have a chance to write the story of\\nour times — a story of courage defeating cruelty, and\\nlight overcoming darkness. This calling is worthy of\\nany life, and worthy of every nation. So let us go\\nforward — confident, determined and unafraid.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n","5002  ﻿We meet one year and one day\\nafter a terrorist attack brought grief to my country and\\nbrought grief to many citizens of our world. Yesterday,\\nwe remembered the innocent lives taken that terrible\\nmorning. Today we turn to the urgent duty of\\nprotecting other lives without illusion and without fear.\\nWe have accomplished much in the last year — in\\nAfghanistan and beyond. We have much yet to do — in\\nAfghanistan and beyond. Many nations represented\\nhere have joined in the fight against global terror, and\\nthe people of the United States are grateful.\\nThe United Nations was born in the hope that\\nsurvived a world war — the hope of a world moving\\ntowards justice, escaping old patterns of conflict and\\nfear. The founding Members resolved that the peace of\\nthe world must never again be destroyed by the will\\nand the wickedness of any man. We created the United\\nNations Security Council so that, unlike the League of\\nNations, our deliberations would be more than talk, our\\nresolutions would be more than wishes. After\\ngenerations of deceitful dictators, broken treaties and\\nsquandered lives, we dedicated ourselves to standards\\nof human dignity, shared by all, and to a system of\\nsecurity defended by all.\\nToday, these standards, and this security, are\\nchallenged.\\nOur commitment to human dignity is challenged\\nby persistent poverty and raging disease. The suffering\\nis great, and our responsibilities are clear. The United\\nStates is joining with the world to supply aid where it\\nreaches people and lifts up lives, to extend trade and\\nthe prosperity it brings, and to bring medical care\\nwhere it is desperately needed.\\nAs a symbol of our commitment to human\\ndignity, the United States will return to the United\\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\\nOrganization (UNESCO). This organization has been\\nreformed, and America will participate fully in its\\nmission to advance human rights, tolerance and\\nlearning.\\nOur common security is challenged by regional\\nconflicts — ethnic and religious strife that is ancient,\\nbut not inevitable. In the Middle East, there can be no\\npeace for either side without freedom for both sides.\\nAmerica stands committed to an independent and\\ndemocratic Palestine, living side by side with Israel in\\npeace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians\\ndeserve a government that serves their interests and\\nlistens to their voices. My nation will continue to\\nencourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities\\nas we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the\\nconflict.\\nAbove all, our principles and our security are\\nchallenged today by outlaw groups and regimes that\\naccept no law of morality and have no limit to their\\nviolent ambitions. In the attacks on America a year\\nago, we saw the destructive intentions of our enemies.\\nThis threat hides within many nations, including my\\nown. In cells and camps, terrorists are plotting further\\ndestruction and are building new bases for their war\\nagainst civilization. And our greatest fear is that\\nterrorists will find a shortcut to their mad ambitions\\nwhen an outlaw regime supplies them with the\\ntechnologies enabling them to kill on a massive scale.\\nIn one place, in one regime, we find all these\\ndangers, in their most lethal and aggressive forms —\\nexactly the kind of aggressive threat the United Nations\\nwas born to confront. Twelve years ago, Iraq invaded\\nKuwait without provocation. And the regime's forces\\nwere poised to continue their march to seize other\\ncountries and their resources. Had Saddam Hussein\\nbeen appeased instead of stopped, he would have\\nendangered the peace and stability of the world. Yet,\\nthis aggression was stopped by the might of coalition\\nforces and the will of the United Nations.\\nIn order to suspend hostilities and to spare\\nhimself, Iraq's dictator accepted a series of\\ncommitments. The terms were clear to him, and to all.\\nAnd he agreed to prove that he is complying with every\\none of those obligations. He has proven instead only\\nhis contempt for the United Nations and for all his\\npledges. By breaking every pledge, by his deceptions\\nand by his cruelties, Saddam Hussein has made the\\ncase against himself.\\nIn 1991, Security Council resolution 688 (1991)\\ndemanded that the Iraqi regime cease at once the\\nrepression of its own people, including the systematic\\nrepression of minorities, which the Council said,\\n“threaten[ed] international peace and security in the\\nregion”.\\nThis demand goes ignored. Last year, the United\\nNations Commission on Human Rights found that Iraq\\ncontinues to commit extremely grave violations of\\nhuman rights and that the regime's repression is all\\npervasive. Tens of thousands of political opponents and\\n7\\n\\nordinary citizens have been subjected to arbitrary arrest\\nand imprisonment, summary execution, and torture by\\nbeating, burning, electric shock, starvation, mutilation\\nand rape. Wives are tortured in front of their husbands;\\nchildren in the presence of their parents; and all of\\nthese horrors are concealed from the world by the\\napparatus of a totalitarian State.\\nIn 1991, the United Nations Security Council,\\nthrough its resolutions 686 (1991) and 687 (1991),\\ndemanded that Iraq return all prisoners from Kuwait\\nand other lands. Iraq's regime agreed. It broke this\\npromise. Last year the Secretary-General's high-level\\ncoordinator for this issue reported that Kuwaiti, Saudi,\\nIndian, Syrian, Lebanese, Iranian, Egyptian, Bahraini,\\nand Omani nationals remain unaccounted for — more\\nthan 600 people. One American pilot is among them.\\nIn 1991, the United Nations Security Council,\\nthrough resolution 687 (1991), demanded that Iraq\\nrenounce all involvement with terrorism and permit no\\nterrorist organizations to operate in Iraq. Iraq's regime\\nagreed. It broke this promise. In violation of Security\\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001), Iraq continues to\\nshelter and support terrorist organizations that direct\\nviolence against Iran, Israel, and Western\\nGovernments. Iraqi dissidents abroad are targeted for\\nmurder. In 1993, Iraq attempted to assassinate the Emir\\nof Kuwait and a former American President. Iraq's\\nGovernment openly praised the attacks of 11\\nSeptember. Al-Qaida terrorists have escaped from\\nAfghanistan and are known to be in Iraq.\\nIn 1991, the Iraqi regime agreed to destroy and to\\nstop developing all weapons of mass destruction and\\nlong-range missiles, and to prove to the world it has\\ndone so by complying with rigorous inspections. Iraq\\nhas broken every aspect of this fundamental pledge.\\nFrom 1991 to 1995, the Iraqi regime said it had\\nno biological weapons. After a senior official in its\\nweapons program defected and exposed this lie, the\\nregime admitted to producing tens of thousands of\\nlitres of anthrax and other deadly biological agents for\\nuse in Scud missile warheads, aerial bombs and aircraft\\nspray tanks. United Nations inspectors believe Iraq has\\nproduced two to four times the amount of biological\\nagents it declared and has failed to account for more\\nthan three metric tons of material that could be used to\\nproduce biological weapons. Right now, Iraq is\\nexpanding and improving facilities that were used for\\nthe production of biological weapons.\\nUnited Nations inspections also reveal that Iraq\\nlikely maintains stockpiles of VX, mustard and other\\nchemical agents, and that the regime is rebuilding and\\nexpanding facilities capable of producing chemical\\nweapons.\\nAnd in 1995, after four years of deception, Iraq\\nfinally admitted that it had had a crash nuclear\\nweapons programme prior to the Gulf war. We know\\nnow that, were it not for that war, the regime in Iraq\\nwould likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later\\nthan 1993.\\nToday, Iraq continues to withhold important\\ninformation about its nuclear programme: weapons\\ndesign, procurement logs, experiment data, an\\naccounting of nuclear materials and documentation of\\nforeign assistance. Iraq employs capable nuclear\\nscientists and technicians. It retains physical\\ninfrastructure needed to build a nuclear weapon. Iraq\\nhas made several attempts to buy high-strength\\naluminium tubes used to enrich uranium for a nuclear\\nweapon. Should Iraq acquire fissile material, it would\\nbe able to build a nuclear weapon within a year. And\\nIraq's State-controlled media have reported numerous\\nmeetings between Saddam Hussein and his nuclear\\nscientists, leaving little doubt about his continued\\nappetite for these weapons.\\nIraq also possesses a force of Scud-type missiles\\nwith ranges beyond the 150 kilometres permitted by the\\nUnited Nations. Work at testing and production\\nfacilities shows that Iraq is building more long-range\\nmissiles that can inflict mass death throughout the\\nregion.\\nIn 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the\\nworld imposed economic sanctions on Iraq. Those\\nsanctions were maintained after the war to compel the\\nregime's compliance with Security Council resolutions.\\nIn time, Iraq was allowed to use oil revenues to buy\\nfood. Saddam Hussein has subverted that programme,\\nworking around the sanctions to buy missile\\ntechnology and military materials. He blames the\\nsuffering of Iraq's people on the United Nations, even\\nas he uses his oil wealth to build lavish palaces for\\nhimself and to buy arms for his country. By refusing to\\ncomply with his own agreements, he bears full guilt for\\nthe hunger and misery of innocent Iraqi citizens.\\nIn 1991, Iraq promised United Nations inspectors\\nimmediate and unrestricted access to verify Iraq's\\ncommitment to rid itself of weapons of mass\\n8\\n\\ndestruction and long-range missiles. Iraq broke that\\npromise, spending seven years deceiving, evading and\\nharassing United Nations inspectors before ceasing\\ncooperation entirely. Just months after the 1991\\nceasefire, the Security Council twice renewed its\\ndemand that the Iraqi regime cooperate fully with\\ninspectors, condemning Iraq's serious violations of its\\nobligations. The Security Council again renewed that\\ndemand in 1994 and twice more in 1996, deploring\\nIraq's clear violations of its obligations. The Security\\nCouncil renewed its demand three more times in 1997,\\nciting flagrant violations, and three more times in\\n1998, calling Iraq's behaviour totally unacceptable.\\nAnd in 1999, the demand was renewed yet again.\\nAs we meet today, it has been almost four years\\nsince the last United Nations inspector set foot in\\nIraq — four years for the Iraqi regime to plan and to\\nbuild and to test behind the cloak of secrecy. We know\\nthat Saddam Hussein pursued weapons of mass murder\\neven when inspectors were in his country. Are we to\\nassume that he stopped when they left? The history, the\\nlogic and the facts lead to one conclusion. Saddam\\nHussein's regime is a grave and gathering danger. To\\nsuggest otherwise is to hope against the evidence. To\\nassume this regime's good faith is to bet the lives of\\nmillions and the peace of the world in a reckless\\ngamble. And that is a risk we must not take.\\nWe have been more than patient. We have tried\\nsanctions. We have tried the carrot of oil-for-food and\\nthe stick of coalition military strikes. But Saddam\\nHussein has defied all those efforts and continues to\\ndevelop weapons of mass destruction. The first time we\\nmay be completely certain he has nuclear weapons is\\nwhen, God forbid, he uses one. We owe it to all our\\ncitizens to do everything in our power to prevent that\\nday from coming.\\nThe conduct of the Iraqi regime is a threat to the\\nauthority of the United Nations and a threat to peace.\\nIraq has answered a decade of United Nations demands\\nwith a decade of defiance. All the world now faces a\\ntest and the United Nations a difficult and defining\\nmoment. Are Security Council resolutions to be\\nhonoured and enforced or cast aside without\\nconsequence? Will the United Nations serve the\\npurpose of its founding, or will it be irrelevant?\\nThe United States helped found the United\\nNations. We want the United Nations to be effective\\nand respected and successful. We want the resolutions\\nof the world's most important multilateral body to be\\nenforced, and right now those resolutions are being\\nunilaterally subverted by the Iraqi regime. Our\\npartnership of nations can meet the test before us by\\nmaking clear what we now expect of the Iraqi regime.\\nIf the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will\\nimmediately and unconditionally forswear, disclose\\nand remove or destroy all weapons of mass destruction,\\nlong-range missiles and all related material.\\nIf the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will\\nimmediately end all support for terrorism and act to\\nsuppress it, as all States are required to do by Security\\nCouncil resolutions.\\nIf the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will cease\\npersecution of its civilian population, including Shia,\\nSunnis, Kurds, Turkomans and others — again, as\\nrequired by Security Council resolutions.\\nIf the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will release or\\naccount for all Gulf war personnel whose fate is still\\nunknown. It will return the remains of any who are\\ndeceased, return stolen property, accept liability for\\nlosses resulting from the invasion of Kuwait and fully\\ncooperate with international efforts to resolve those\\nissues, as required by Security Council resolutions.\\nIf the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will\\nimmediately end all illicit trade outside the oil-for-food\\nprogramme. It will accept United Nations\\nadministration of funds from that programme, to ensure\\nthat the money is used fairly and promptly for the\\nbenefit of the Iraqi people.\\nIf all those steps are taken, it will signal a new\\nopenness and accountability in Iraq. And it could open\\nthe prospect of the United Nations helping to build a\\nGovernment that represents all Iraqis — a Government\\nbased on respect for human rights, economic liberty\\nand internationally supervised elections.\\nThe United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi\\npeople. They have suffered too long in silent captivity.\\nLiberty for the Iraqi people is a great moral cause and a\\ngreat strategic goal. The people of Iraq deserve it. The\\nsecurity of all nations requires it.\\nFree societies do not intimidate through cruelty\\nand conquest, and open societies do not threaten the\\nworld with mass murder. The United States supports\\npolitical and economic liberty in a unified Iraq.\\n9\\n\\nWe can harbour no illusions, and that is important\\ntoday to remember. Saddam Hussein attacked Iran in\\n1980 and Kuwait in 1990. He has fired ballistic\\nmissiles at Iran and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Israel.\\nHis regime once ordered the killing of every person\\nbetween the ages of 15 and 70 in certain Kurdish\\nvillages in northern Iraq. He has gassed many Iranians\\nand 40 Iraqi villages.\\nMy nation will work with the Security Council to\\nmeet our common challenge. If Iraq's regime defies us\\nagain, the world must move deliberately and decisively\\nto hold Iraq to account. We will work with the Security\\nCouncil for the necessary resolutions. But the purposes\\nof the United States should not be doubted. The\\nSecurity Council resolutions will be enforced, and the\\njust demands of peace and security will be met, or\\naction will be unavoidable, and a regime that has lost\\nits legitimacy will also lose its power.\\nEvents can turn in one of two ways.\\nIf we fail to act in the face of danger, the people\\nof Iraq will continue to live in brutal submission. The\\nregime will have new power to bully, dominate and\\nconquer its neighbours, condemning the Middle East to\\nmore years of bloodshed and fear. The region will\\nremain unstable, with little hope of freedom, and\\nisolated from the progress of our times. With every step\\nthe Iraqi regime takes towards gaining and deploying\\nthe most terrible weapons, our own options to confront\\nthat regime will narrow. And if an emboldened regime\\nwere to supply these weapons to terrorist allies, then\\nthe attacks of 11 September would be a prelude to far\\ngreater horrors.\\nIf we meet our responsibilities, if we overcome\\nthis danger, we can arrive at a very different future.\\nThe people of Iraq can shake off their captivity. They\\ncan one day join a democratic Afghanistan and a\\ndemocratic Palestine, inspiring reforms throughout the\\nMuslim world. These nations can show by their\\nexample that honest government, respect for women,\\nand the great Islamic tradition of learning can triumph\\nin the Middle East and beyond. We will show that the\\npromise of the United Nations can be fulfilled in our\\ntime.\\nNeither of these outcomes is certain. Both have\\nbeen set before us. We must choose between a world of\\nfear and a world of progress. We cannot stand by and\\ndo nothing while dangers gather. We must stand up for\\nour security and for the permanent rights and hopes of\\nmankind. By heritage and by choice, the United States\\nof America will make that stand. Representatives to the\\nUnited Nations have the power to make that stand as\\nwell.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n","5191  ﻿Twenty-four months ago, and\\nyesterday in the memory of America, the centre of New\\nYork City became a battlefield, and a graveyard, and\\nthe symbol of an unfinished war. Since that day,\\nterrorists have struck in Bali, in Mombassa, in\\n9\\n\\nCasablanca, in Riyadh, in Jakarta, in Jerusalem,\\nmeasuring the advance of their cause in the chaos and\\ninnocent suffering they leave behind.\\nLast month, terrorists brought their war to the\\nUnited Nations itself. The United Nations headquarters\\nin Baghdad stood for order and compassion. For that\\nreason, the terrorists decided it must be destroyed.\\nAmong the 22 people who were murdered was Sergio\\nVieira de Mello. Over the decades, that good and brave\\nman from Brazil gave help to the afflicted in\\nBangladesh, Cyprus, Mozambique, Lebanon,\\nCambodia, Central Africa, Kosovo and East Timor, and\\nwas aiding the people of Iraq in their time of need.\\nAmerica joins you, his colleagues, in honouring the\\nmemory of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and the memory\\nof all those who died with him in the service of the\\nUnited Nations.\\nBy the victims they choose and by the means they\\nuse, the terrorists have clarified the struggle we are in.\\nThose who target relief workers for death have set\\nthemselves against all humanity. Those who incite\\nmurder and celebrate suicide reveal their contempt for\\nlife itself. They have no place in any religious faith,\\nthey have no claim on the world's sympathy, and they\\nshould have no friend in this Hall.\\nEvents during the past two years have set before\\nus the clearest of divides: between those who seek\\norder and those who spread chaos, between those who\\nwork for peaceful change and those who adopt the\\nmethods of gangsters, between those who honour the\\nrights of man and those who deliberately take the lives\\nof men, women and children without mercy or shame.\\nBetween those alternatives there is no neutral\\nground. All Governments that support terror are\\ncomplicit in a war against civilization. No Government\\nshould ignore the threat of terror because to look the\\nother way gives terrorists the chance to regroup, recruit\\nand prepare. All nations that fight terror as if the lives\\nof their own people depended on it will earn the\\nfavourable judgement of history.\\nThe former regimes of Afghanistan and Iraq knew\\nthose alternatives and made their choices. The Taliban\\nwas a sponsor and servant of terrorism. When\\nconfronted, that regime chose defiance, and that regime\\nis no more. Afghanistan's President, who is here today,\\nnow represents a free people who are building a decent\\nand just society. They are building a nation fully joined\\nin the war against terror.\\nThe regime of Saddam Hussain cultivated ties to\\nterror while it built weapons of mass destruction. It\\nused those weapons in acts of mass murder and refused\\nto account for them when confronted by the world. The\\nSecurity Council was right to be alarmed. The Security\\nCouncil was right to demand that Iraq destroy its\\nillegal weapons and prove that it had done so. The\\nSecurity Council was right to vow serious\\nconsequences if Iraq refused to comply. And because\\nthere were consequences   because a coalition of\\nnations acted to defend the peace and the credibility of\\nthe United Nations   Iraq is free, and today we are\\njoined by the representatives of a liberated country.\\nSaddam Hussain's monuments have been\\nremoved, and not only his statues. The true monuments\\nof his rule and his character   the torture chambers,\\nthe rape rooms and the prison cells for innocent\\nchildren   are closed. And as we discover the killing\\nfields and mass graves of Iraq, the true scale of\\nSaddam's cruelty is being revealed.\\nThe Iraqi people are meeting hardships and\\nchallenges, like every nation that has set out on the\\npath of democracy. Yet, their future promises lives of\\ndignity and freedom, and that is a world away from the\\nsqualid, vicious tyranny they have known. Across Iraq,\\nlife is being improved by liberty. Across the Middle\\nEast, people are safer because an unstable aggressor\\nhas been removed from power. Across the world,\\nnations are more secure because an ally of terror has\\nfallen.\\nOur actions in Afghanistan and Iraq were\\nsupported by many Governments, and America is\\ngrateful to each one. I also recognize that some of the\\nsovereign nations of the Assembly disagreed with our\\nactions. Yet, there was and there remains unity among\\nus on the fundamental principles and objectives of the\\nUnited Nations. We are dedicated to the defence of our\\ncollective security and to the advance of human rights.\\nThose permanent commitments call us to great work in\\nthe world, work that we must do together. So, let us\\nmove forward. First, we must stand with the people of\\nAfghanistan and Iraq as they build free and stable\\ncountries. The terrorists and their allies fear and fight\\nthis progress above all because free people embrace\\nhope over resentment and choose peace over violence.\\nThe United Nations has been a friend of the\\nAfghan people, distributing food and medicine, helping\\nrefugees return home, advising on a new constitution\\n10\\n\\nand helping to prepare the way for nationwide\\nelections. NATO has taken over the United Nations\\nmandated security force in Kabul. American and\\ncoalition forces continue to track and defeat al Qaeda\\nterrorists and the remnants of the Taliban. Our efforts\\nto rebuild that country go on. I have recently proposed\\nto spend an additional $1.2 billion for the Afghan\\nreconstruction effort, and I urge other nations to\\ncontinue contributing to that important cause.\\nIn the nation of Iraq, the United Nations is\\ncarrying out vital and effective work every day. By the\\nend of 2004, more than 90 per cent of Iraqi children\\nunder age five will have been immunized against\\npreventable diseases such as polio, tuberculosis and\\nmeasles, thanks to the hard work and high ideals of\\nUNICEF. Iraq's food distribution system is operational,\\ndelivering nearly a half million tons of food per month,\\nthanks to the skill and expertise of the World Food\\nProgramme.\\nOur international coalition in Iraq is meeting its\\nresponsibilities. We are conducting precision raids\\nagainst terrorists and holdouts of the former regime.\\nThose killers are at war with the Iraqi people. They\\nhave made Iraq the central front in the war on terror.\\nAnd they will be defeated. Our coalition has made sure\\nthat Iraq's former dictator will never again use\\nweapons of mass destruction. We are now interviewing\\nIraqi citizens and analysing records of the old regime\\nto reveal the full extent of its weapons programmes and\\nits long campaign of deception. We are training Iraqi\\npolice, border guards and a new army so that the Iraqi\\npeople can assume full responsibility for their own\\nsecurity.\\nAt the same time, our coalition is helping to\\nimprove the daily lives of the Iraqi people. The old\\nregime built palaces while letting schools decay, so we\\nare rebuilding more than a thousand schools. The old\\nregime starved hospitals of resources, so we have\\nhelped to supply and reopen hospitals across Iraq. The\\nold regime built up armies and weapons while allowing\\nthe nation's infrastructure to crumble, so we are\\nrehabilitating power plants, water and sanitation\\nfacilities, bridges and airports. I have proposed to\\nCongress that the United States provide additional\\nfunding for our work in Iraq, the greatest financial\\ncommitment of its kind since the Marshall Plan.\\nHaving helped to liberate Iraq, we will honour\\nour pledges to Iraq, and by helping the Iraqi people\\nbuild a stable and peaceful country we will make our\\nown countries more secure.\\nThe primary goal of our coalition in Iraq is self-\\ngovernment for the people of Iraq, reached by an\\norderly and democratic process. That process must\\nunfold according to the needs of Iraqis, neither hurried\\nnor delayed by the wishes of other parties. And the\\nUnited Nations can contribute greatly to the cause of\\nIraqi self-government.\\nAmerica is working with friends and allies on a\\nnew Security Council resolution, which will expand the\\nUnited Nation's role in Iraq. As in the aftermath of\\nother conflicts, the United Nations should assist in\\ndeveloping a constitution, training civil servants and\\nconducting free and fair elections. Iraq now has a\\nGoverning Council, the first truly representative\\ninstitution in that country. Iraq's new leaders are\\nshowing the openness and tolerance that democracy\\nrequires, and they are also showing courage. Yet every\\nyoung democracy needs the help of friends. Now the\\nnation of Iraq needs and deserves our aid, and all\\nnations of good will should step forward and provide\\nthat support.\\nThe success of a free Iraq will be watched and\\nnoted throughout the region. Millions will see that\\nfreedom, equality and material progress are possible at\\nthe heart of the Middle East. Leaders in the region will\\nface the clearest evidence that free institutions and\\nopen societies are the only path to long-term national\\nsuccess and dignity. And a transformed Middle East\\nwould benefit the entire world by undermining the\\nideologies that export violence to other lands.\\nIraq as a dictatorship had great power to\\ndestabilize the Middle East. Iraq as a democracy will\\nhave great power to inspire the Middle East. The\\nadvance of democratic institutions in Iraq is setting an\\nexample that others, including the Palestinian people,\\nwould be wise to follow. The Palestinian cause is\\nbetrayed by leaders who cling to power by feeding old\\nhatreds and destroying the good work of others. The\\nPalestinian people deserve their own State. They will\\ngain that State by embracing new leaders committed to\\nreform, to fighting terror and to building peace.\\nAll parties in the Middle East must meet their\\nresponsibilities and carry out the commitments they\\nmade at Aqaba. Israel must work to create the\\nconditions that will allow a peaceful Palestinian State\\nto emerge. Arab nations must cut off funding and other\\n11\\n\\nsupport for terrorist organizations. America will work\\nwith every nation in the region that acts boldly for the\\nsake of peace.\\nA second challenge we must confront together is\\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\\nOutlaw regimes that possess nuclear, chemical and\\nbiological weapons and the means to deliver them\\nwould be able to use blackmail and create chaos in\\nentire regions. Those weapons could be used by\\nterrorists to bring sudden disaster and suffering on a\\nscale we can scarcely imagine. The deadly combination\\nof outlaw regimes, terror networks and weapons of\\nmass murder is a peril that cannot be ignored or wished\\naway. If such a danger is allowed to fully materialize,\\nall words, all protests, will come too late.\\nNations of the world must have the wisdom and\\nthe will to stop grave threats before they arrive. One\\ncrucial step is to secure the most dangerous materials at\\ntheir source. For more than a decade, the United States\\nhas worked with Russia and other States of the former\\nSoviet Union to dismantle, destroy or secure weapons\\nand dangerous materials left over from another era.\\nLast year in Canada, the G-8 nations agreed to\\nprovide up to 20 billion dollars, half of it from the\\nUnited States, to fight this proliferation risk over the\\nnext ten years. Since then, six additional countries have\\njoined the effort. More are needed, and I urge other\\nnations to help us meet this danger.\\nWe are also improving our capability to interdict\\nlethal materials in transit. Through our Proliferation\\nSecurity Initiative, eleven nations are preparing to\\nsearch planes, ships, trains and trucks carrying suspect\\ncargo and to seize weapons or missile shipments that\\nraise proliferation concerns. These nations have agreed\\non a set of interdiction principles consistent with\\ncurrent legal authorities, and we are working to expand\\nthe Proliferation Security Initiative to other countries.\\nWe are determined to keep the world's most destructive\\nweapons away from all our shores and out of the hands\\nof our common enemies.\\nBecause proliferators will use any route or\\nchannel that is open to them, we need the broadest\\npossible cooperation to stop them. Today I ask the\\nUnited Nations Security Council to adopt a new\\nantiproliferation resolution. That resolution should call\\non all Members of the United Nations to criminalize\\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, to\\nenact strict export controls consistent with international\\nstandards and to secure any and all sensitive materials\\nwithin their own borders. The United States stands\\nready to help any nation draft these new laws and to\\nassist in their enforcement.\\nA third challenge we share is a challenge to our\\nconscience. We must act decisively to meet the\\nhumanitarian crises of our time. The United States has\\nbegun to carry out the Emergency Plan for AIDS\\nRelief, aimed at preventing AIDS on a massive scale\\nand treating millions who have the disease already. We\\nhave pledged 15 billion dollars over five years to fight\\nAIDS around the world.\\nMy country is acting to save lives from famine as\\nwell. We are providing more than 1.4 billion dollars in\\nglobal emergency food aid, and I have asked our\\nUnited States Congress for 200 million dollars for a\\nnew famine fund so that we can act quickly when the\\nfirst signs of famine appear. Every nation on every\\ncontinent should generously add their resources to the\\nfight against disease and desperate hunger.\\nThere is another humanitarian crisis, spreading,\\nyet hidden from view. Each year, an estimated eight to\\nnine hundred thousand human beings are bought, sold\\nor forced across the world's borders. Among them are\\nhundreds of thousands of teenage girls and others as\\nyoung as five who fall victim to the sex trade. This\\ncommerce in human life generates billions of dollars\\neach year, much of which is used to finance organized\\ncrime. There is a special evil in the abuse and\\nexploitation of the most innocent and vulnerable. The\\nvictims of the sex trade see little of life before they see\\nthe very worst of life   an underground of brutality\\nand lonely fear. Those who create these victims and\\nprofit from their suffering must be severely punished.\\nThose who patronize this industry debase themselves\\nand deepen the misery of others, and Governments that\\ntolerate this trade are tolerating a form of slavery.\\nThis problem has appeared in my own country\\nand we are working to stop it. The Protect Act, which I\\nsigned into law this year, makes it a crime for any\\nperson to enter the United States or for any citizen to\\ntravel abroad for the purpose of sex tourism involving\\nchildren. The Department of Justice is actively\\ninvestigating sex tour operators and patrons, who can\\nface up to 30 years in prison. Under the Trafficking\\nVictims Protection Act, the United States is using\\nsanctions against Governments to discourage human\\ntrafficking.\\n12\\n\\nThe victims of this industry also need help from\\nMembers of the United Nations. This begins with clear\\nstandards and the certainty of punishment under the\\nlaws of every country. Today, some nations make it a\\ncrime to sexually abuse children abroad. Such conduct\\nshould be a crime in all nations. Governments should\\ninform travellers of the harm this industry does and the\\nsevere punishments that will fall on its patrons. The\\nAmerican Government is committing $50 million to\\nsupport the good work of organizations that are\\nrescuing women and children from exploitation and\\ngiving them shelter, medical treatment and the hope of\\na new life. I urge other Governments to do their part.\\nWe must show new energy in fighting back an old\\nevil. Nearly two centuries after the abolition of the\\ntransatlantic slave trade and more than a century after\\nslavery was officially ended in its last strongholds, the\\ntrade in human beings for any purpose must not be\\nallowed to thrive in our time.\\nAll the challenges I have spoken of this morning\\nrequire urgent attention and moral clarity. Helping\\nAfghanistan and Iraq to succeed as free nations in a\\ntransformed region; cutting off the avenues of\\nproliferation; abolishing modern forms of slavery  \\nthese are the kinds of great tasks for which the United\\nNations was founded. In each case, careful discussion\\nis needed and, also, decisive action. Our good\\nintentions will be credited only if we achieve good\\noutcomes. As an original signer of the United Nations\\nCharter, the United States of America is committed to\\nthe United Nations and we show that commitment by\\nworking to fulfil the United Nations stated purposes\\nand by giving meaning to its ideals.\\nThe founding documents of the United Nations\\nand the founding documents of America stand in the\\nsame tradition. Both assert that human beings should\\nnever be reduced to objects of power or commerce,\\nbecause their dignity is inherent.

The American\\npeople respect the idealism that gave life to this\\nOrganization. And we respect the men and women of\\nthe United Nations, who stand for peace and human\\nrights in every part of the world. Welcome to New\\nYork City, and welcome to the United States of\\nAmerica.\\nDuring the past three years, I have addressed the\\nGeneral Assembly in a time of tragedy for my country,\\nand in times of decision for all of us. Now we gather at\\na time of tremendous opportunity for the United\\nNations and for all peaceful nations. For decades, the\\ncircle of liberty, security and development has been\\nexpanding in our world. This progress has brought\\nunity to Europe, self-government to Latin America and\\nAsia and new hope to Africa. Now we have the historic\\n8\\n\\nchance to widen the circle even further, to fight\\nradicalism and terror with justice and dignity and to\\nachieve a true peace, founded on human freedom.\\nThe United Nations and my country share the\\ndeepest commitments. Both the American Declaration\\nof Independence and the Universal Declaration of\\nHuman Rights proclaim the equal value and dignity of\\nevery human life. That dignity is honoured by the rule\\nof law, limits on the power of the State, respect for\\nwomen, protection of private property, free speech,\\nequal justice and religious tolerance. That dignity is\\ndishonoured by oppression, corruption, tyranny,\\nbigotry, terrorism and all violence against the innocent.\\nBoth our founding documents affirm that this bright\\nline between justice and injustice — between right and\\nwrong — is the same in every age, every culture and\\nevery nation.\\nWise Governments also stand for these principles\\nfor very practical and realistic reasons. We know that\\ndictators are quick to choose aggression, while free\\nnations strive to resolve differences in peace. We know\\nthat oppressive Governments support terror, while free\\nGovernments fight the terrorists in their midst. We\\nknow that free peoples embrace progress and life,\\ninstead of becoming the recruits for murderous\\nideologies.\\nEvery nation that wants peace will share the\\nbenefits of a freer world. And every nation that seeks\\npeace has an obligation to help build that world.\\nEventually there is no safe isolation from terror\\nnetworks, or failed States that shelter them, or outlaw\\nregimes or weapons of mass destruction. Eventually\\nthere is no safety in looking away, seeking the quiet\\nlife by ignoring the struggles and oppression of others.\\nIn this young century our world needs a new\\ndefinition of security. Our security is not merely found\\nin spheres of influence or some balance of power. The\\nsecurity of our world is found in the advancing rights\\nof mankind.\\nThose rights are advancing across the world. And\\nacross the world, the enemies of human rights are\\nresponding with violence. Terrorists and their allies\\nbelieve the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and\\nthe United States Bill of Rights and every charter of\\nliberty ever written are lies to be burned and destroyed\\nand forgotten. They believe that dictators should\\ncontrol every mind and tongue in the Middle East and\\nbeyond. They believe that suicide and torture and\\nmurder are fully justified to serve any goal they\\ndeclare. And they act on their beliefs.\\nIn the last year alone terrorists have attacked\\npolice stations and banks and commuter trains and\\nsynagogues and a school filled with children. This\\nmonth in Beslan we saw once again how the terrorists\\nmeasure their success in the death of the innocent and\\nin the pain of grieving families. Svetlana Dzebisov was\\nheld hostage along with her son and her nephew. Her\\nnephew did not survive. She recently visited the\\ncemetery and saw what she called the “little graves”.\\nShe said, “I understand that there is evil in the world,\\nbut what have these little creatures done?”\\nThe Russian children did nothing to deserve such\\nawful suffering and fright and death. The people of\\nMadrid and Jerusalem and Istanbul and Baghdad have\\ndone nothing to deserve sudden and random murder.\\nThose acts violate the standards of justice in all\\ncultures and the principles of all religions. All civilized\\nnations are in this struggle together and all must fight\\nthe murderers.\\nWe are determined to destroy terror networks\\nwherever they operate, and the United States is grateful\\nto every nation that is helping to seize terrorist assets,\\ntrack down their operatives and disrupt their plans. We\\nare determined to end the State sponsorship of terror,\\nand my nation is grateful to all that participated in the\\nliberation of Afghanistan. We are determined to\\nprevent proliferation and to enforce the demands of the\\nworld, and my nation is grateful to the soldiers of many\\nnations who have helped to deliver the Iraqi people\\nfrom an outlaw dictator.\\nThe dictator agreed in 1991, as a condition of a\\nceasefire, to fully comply with all Security Council\\nresolutions, then ignored more than a decade of those\\nresolutions. Finally, the Security Council promised\\nserious consequences for his defiance. The\\ncommitments we make must have meaning. When we\\nsay “serious consequences”, for the sake of peace there\\nmust be serious consequences. So a coalition of nations\\nenforced the just demands of the world.\\nDefending our ideals is vital, but it is not enough.\\nOur broader mission as United Nations Members is to\\napply those ideals to the great issues of our time. Our\\nwider goal is to promote hope and progress as the\\nalternatives to hatred and violence. Our great purpose\\nis to build a better world beyond the war on terror.\\n9\\n\\nBecause we believe in human dignity, the United\\nStates and many other nations have established a\\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.\\nIn three years the contributing countries have funded\\nprojects in more than 90 countries, and pledged a total\\nof $5.6 billion to those efforts. America has undertaken\\na $15 billion effort to provide prevention and treatment\\nand humane care in nations afflicted by AIDS, placing\\na special focus on 15 countries where the need is most\\nurgent. AIDS is the greatest health crisis of our time,\\nand our unprecedented commitment will bring new\\nhope to those who have walked too long in the shadow\\nof death.\\nBecause we believe in human dignity, the United\\nStates and many other nations have joined together to\\nconfront the evil of trafficking in human beings. We\\nare supporting organizations that rescue the victims,\\npassing stronger anti-trafficking laws and warning\\ntravellers that they will be held to account for\\nsupporting this modern form of slavery. Women and\\nchildren should never be exploited for pleasure or\\ngreed, anywhere on Earth.\\nBecause we believe in human dignity, we should\\ntake seriously the protection of life from exploitation\\nunder any pretext. In this session, the General\\nAssembly will consider a draft resolution sponsored by\\nCosta Rica calling for a comprehensive ban on human\\ncloning. I support that draft resolution and urge all\\nGovernments to affirm a basic ethical principle: no\\nhuman life should ever be produced or destroyed for\\nthe benefit of another.\\nBecause we believe in human dignity, the United\\nStates and many other nations have changed the way\\nwe fight poverty, curb corruption and provide aid. In\\n2002 we created the Monterrey Consensus, a bold\\napproach that links new aid from developed nations to\\nreal reform in developing ones. And through the\\nMillennium Challenge Account, my nation is\\nincreasing our aid to developing nations that expand\\neconomic freedom and invest in the education and\\nhealth of their own people.\\nBecause we believe in human dignity, the United\\nStates and many other nations have acted to lift the\\ncrushing burden of debt that limits the growth of\\ndeveloping economies and holds millions of people in\\npoverty. Since those efforts began in 1996, poor\\ncountries with the heaviest debt burdens have received\\nmore than $30 billion of relief. And to prevent the\\nbuild-up of future debt, my country and other nations\\nhave agreed that international financial institutions\\nshould increasingly provide new aid in the form of\\ngrants rather than loans.\\nBecause we believe in human dignity, the world\\nmust have more effective means to stabilize regions in\\nturmoil and to halt religious violence and ethnic\\ncleansing. We must create permanent capabilities to\\nrespond to future crises.\\nThe United States and Italy have proposed a\\nGlobal Peace Operations Initiative. Group of Eight\\n(G-8) countries will train 75,000 peacekeepers —\\ninitially from Africa — so they can conduct operations\\non that continent and elsewhere. The countries of the\\nG-8 will help that peacekeeping force with deployment\\nand logistical needs.\\nAt this hour, the world is witnessing terrible\\nsuffering and horrible crimes in the Darfur region of\\nthe Sudan, crimes my Government has concluded are\\ngenocide. The United States played a key role in efforts\\nto broker a ceasefire, and we are providing\\nhumanitarian assistance to the Sudanese people.\\nRwanda and Nigeria have deployed forces in the Sudan\\nto help improve security so that aid can be delivered.\\nThe Security Council adopted a new resolution that\\nsupports an expanded African Union force to help\\nprevent further bloodshed and that urges the\\nGovernment of the Sudan to stop flights by military\\naircraft in Darfur. We congratulate the members of the\\nCouncil on this timely and necessary action. I call on\\nthe Government of the Sudan to honour the ceasefire it\\nsigned, and to stop the killing in Darfur.\\nBecause we believe in human dignity, peaceful\\nnations must stand for the advance of democracy. No\\nother system of government has done more to protect\\nminorities, to secure the rights of labour, to raise the\\nstatus of women or to channel human energy to the\\npursuits of peace. We have witnessed the rise of\\ndemocratic Governments in predominantly Hindu and\\nMuslim, Buddhist, Jewish and Christian cultures.\\nDemocratic institutions have taken root in modern\\nsocieties and in traditional societies. When it comes to\\nthe desire for liberty and justice, there is no clash of\\ncivilizations. People everywhere are capable of\\nfreedom and worthy of freedom.\\nFinding the full promise of representative\\nGovernment takes time, as America has found in two\\ncenturies of debate and struggle. Nor is there only one\\n10\\n\\nform of representative Government, because\\ndemocracies by definition take on the unique character\\nof the peoples that create them. Yet this much we know\\nwith certainty: the desire for freedom resides in every\\nhuman heart, and that desire cannot be contained\\nforever by prison walls or martial laws or secret police.\\nOver time and across the Earth, freedom will find a\\nway.\\nFreedom is finding a way in Iraq and\\nAfghanistan, and we must continue to show our\\ncommitment to democracies in those nations. The\\nliberty that many have won at a cost must be secured.\\nAs Members of the United Nations, we all have a stake\\nin the success of the world’s newest democracies. Not\\nlong ago, outlaw regimes in Baghdad and Kabul\\nthreatened the peace and sponsored terrorists. Those\\nregimes destabilized one of the world’s most vital and\\nmost volatile regions. They brutalized their peoples in\\ndefiance of all civilized norms.\\nToday, the Iraqi and Afghan peoples are on the\\npath to democracy and freedom. The Governments that\\nare rising will pose no threat to others. Instead of\\nharbouring terrorists, they are fighting terrorist groups.\\nAnd this progress is good for the long-term security of\\nall of us. The Afghan people are showing extraordinary\\ncourage under difficult conditions. They are fighting to\\ndefend their nation from Taliban hold-outs and helping\\nto strike against the terrorist killers. They are reviving\\ntheir economy. They have adopted a Constitution\\nthat protects the rights of all, while honouring their\\nnation’s most cherished traditions. More than 10\\nmillion Afghan citizens — over four million of them\\nwomen — are now registered to vote in next month’s\\npresidential election. To any who still would question\\nwhether Muslim societies can be democratic societies,\\nthe Afghan people are giving their answer.\\nSince the last general debate of this General\\nAssembly, the people of Iraq have regained\\nsovereignty. Today, in this Hall, the Prime Minister of\\nIraq and his delegation represent a country that has\\nrejoined the community of nations. The Government of\\nPrime Minister Allawi has earned the support of every\\nnation that believes in self-determination and desires\\npeace. And under Security Council resolutions 1511\\n(2003) and 1546 (2004), the world is providing that\\nsupport. The United Nations and its Member nations\\nmust respond to Prime Minister Allawi’s request and\\ndo more to help build an Iraq that is secure,\\ndemocratic, federal and free.\\nA democratic Iraq has ruthless enemies because\\nterrorists know the stakes in that country. They know\\nthat a free Iraq in the heart of the Middle East will be a\\ndecisive blow against their ambitions for that region.\\nSo a terrorist group associated with Al Qaeda is now\\none of the main groups killing the innocent in Iraq\\ntoday, conducting a campaign of bombings against\\ncivilians and the beheadings of bound men. Coalition\\nforces now serving in Iraq are confronting the terrorists\\nand foreign fighters so that peaceful nations around the\\nworld will never have to face them within our own\\nborders.\\nOur coalition is standing beside a growing Iraqi\\nsecurity force. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization\\nis providing vital training to that force. More than 35\\nnations have contributed money and expertise to help\\nrebuild Iraq’s infrastructure and, as the Iraqi Interim\\nGovernment moves towards national elections,\\nofficials from the United Nations are helping Iraqis\\nbuild the infrastructure of democracy. Those selfless\\npeople are doing heroic work and are carrying on the\\ngreat legacy of Sergio Vieira de Mello.\\nAs we have seen in other countries, one of the\\nmain terrorist goals is to undermine, disrupt and\\ninfluence election outcomes. We can expect terrorist\\nattacks to escalate as Afghanistan and Iraq approach\\nnational elections. The work ahead is demanding, but\\nthose difficulties will not shake our conviction that the\\nfuture of Afghanistan and Iraq is a future of liberty.\\nThe proper response to difficulty is not to retreat — it\\nis to prevail.\\nThe advance of freedom always carries a cost,\\npaid by the bravest among us. America mourns the\\nlosses to our nation and to many others, and today I\\nassure every friend of Afghanistan and Iraq, and every\\nenemy of liberty: We will stand with the people of\\nAfghanistan and Iraq until their hopes of freedom and\\nsecurity are fulfilled.\\nThese two nations will be a model for the broader\\nMiddle East, a region where millions have been denied\\nbasic human rights and simple justice. For too long,\\nmany nations, including my own, tolerated and even\\nexcused oppression in the Middle East in the name of\\nstability. Oppression became common, but stability\\nnever arrived. We must take a different approach. We\\nmust help the reformers of the Middle East as they\\nwork for freedom and strive to build a community of\\npeaceful, democratic nations.\\n11\\n\\nThat commitment to democratic reform is\\nessential to resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. Peace\\nwill not be achieved by Palestinian rulers who\\nintimidate opposition, tolerate corruption and maintain\\nties to terrorist groups. The long-suffering Palestinian\\npeople deserve better. They deserve true leaders\\ncapable of creating and governing a free and peaceful\\nPalestinian State.\\nEven after the setbacks and frustrations of recent\\nmonths, good will and hard effort can achieve the\\npromise of the road map to peace. Those who would\\nlead a new Palestinian State should adopt peaceful\\nmeans to achieve the rights of their people and create\\nthe reformed institutions of a stable democracy. Arab\\nStates should end incitement in their own media, cut\\noff public and private funding for terrorism, and\\nestablish normal relations with Israel. Israel should\\nimpose a settlement freeze, dismantle unauthorized\\noutposts, end the daily humiliation of the Palestinian\\npeople, and avoid any actions that prejudice final\\nnegotiations. And world leaders should withdraw all\\nfavour and support from any Palestinian ruler who fails\\nhis people and betrays their cause.\\nThe democratic hopes we see growing in the\\nMiddle East are growing everywhere. In the words of\\nthe Burmese democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi:\\n“We do not accept the notion that democracy is a\\nWestern value. To the contrary, democracy simply\\nmeans good Government rooted in responsibility,\\ntransparency and accountability.”\\nHere at the United Nations, Members know this to be\\ntrue. In recent years, this Organization has helped\\ncreate a new democracy in East Timor and the United\\nNations has aided other nations in making the\\ntransition to self-rule.\\nBecause I believe that the advance of liberty is\\nthe path to both a safer and better world, today I\\npropose establishing a democracy fund within the\\nUnited Nations. This is a great calling for this great\\nOrganization. The fund would help countries lay the\\nfoundations of democracy by instituting the rule of law,\\nindependent courts, a free press, political parties and\\ntrade unions. Money from the fund would also help set\\nup voter precincts and polling places and support the\\nwork of election monitors. To show our commitment to\\nthe new democracy fund, the United States will make\\nan initial contribution, and I urge all other nations to\\ncontribute as well.\\nToday I have outlined a broad agenda to advance\\nhuman dignity and enhance the security of all of us.\\nThe defeat of terror, the protection of human rights, the\\nspread of prosperity, the advance of democracy —\\nthese causes, these ideals, call us to great work in the\\nworld. Each of us alone can only do so much. Together\\nwe can accomplish so much more.\\nHistory will honour the high ideals of this\\nOrganization. The Charter states them with clarity: “to\\nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war ...\\nto reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights ... to\\npromote social progress and better standards of life in\\nlarger freedom”.\\nLet history also record that our generation of\\nleaders followed through on these ideals, even in\\nadversity. Let history show that in a decisive decade,\\nmembers of the United Nations did not grow weary in\\nour duties, or waver in meeting them. I am confident\\nthat this young century will be liberty’s century. I\\nbelieve we will rise to this moment, because I know the\\ncharacter of so many nations and leaders represented\\nhere today. And I have faith in the transforming power\\nof freedom.\\nMay God bless you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n","5760  I am grateful for the privilege of \\nspeaking to the General Assembly. \\n Last week, America and the world marked the \\nfifth anniversary of the attacks that filled another \\nSeptember morning with death and suffering. On that \\nterrible day, extremists killed nearly 3,000 innocent \\npeople, including citizens of dozens of nations \\nrepresented right here in this Hall. Since then, the \\nenemies of humanity have continued their campaign of \\nmurder. Al-Qaida and those inspired by its extremist \\nideology have attacked more than two dozen nations. \\nAnd recently, a different group of extremists \\ndeliberately provoked a terrible conflict in Lebanon. At \\nthe start of the twenty-first century, it is clear that the \\nworld is engaged in a great ideological struggle \\nbetween extremists who use terror as a weapon to \\ncreate fear and moderate people who work for peace. \\n Five years ago, I stood at this rostrum and called \\non the community of nations to defend civilization and \\nbuild a more hopeful future. This is still the great \\nchallenge of our time. It is the calling of our \\ngeneration. This morning, I want to speak about the \\nmore hopeful world that is within our reach — a world \\nbeyond terror, where ordinary men and women are free \\nto determine their own destiny, where the voices of \\nmoderation are empowered and where the extremists \\nare marginalized by the peaceful majority. This world \\ncan be ours if we seek it and if we work together. \\n The principles of this world beyond terror can be \\nfound in the very first sentence of the Universal \\nDeclaration of Human Rights. This document declares \\nthat the “equal and inalienable rights of all members of \\nthe human family [are] the foundation of freedom, \\njustice and peace in the world”. One of the authors of \\nthis document was a Lebanese diplomat named Charles \\nMalik, who would go on to become President of this \\nAssembly. Mr. Malik insisted that these principles \\napply equally to all people, of all religions, in all \\nregions — including the men and women of the Arab \\nworld that was his home. \\n In the nearly six decades since that document was \\napproved, we have seen the forces of freedom and \\nmoderation transform entire continents. Sixty years \\nafter a terrible war, Europe is now whole, free and at \\npeace, and Asia has seen freedom progress and \\nhundreds of millions of people lifted out of desperate \\npoverty. The words of the Universal Declaration are as \\ntrue today as they were when they were written. As \\nliberty flourishes, nations grow in tolerance, and hope, \\nand peace. And we are seeing the bright future begin to \\ntake root in the broader Middle East. \\n Some of the changes in the Middle East have \\nbeen dramatic, and we see the results in this Hall. Five \\nyears ago, Afghanistan was ruled by the brutal Taliban \\nregime, and its seat in this body was contested. Now \\nthis seat is held by the freely elected Government of \\nAfghanistan, which is represented today by President \\nKarzai. Five years ago, Iraq’s seat in this body was \\n \\n \\n9 06-52731 \\n \\nheld by a dictator who killed his citizens, invaded his \\nneighbours and showed his contempt for the world by \\ndefying more than a dozen Security Council \\nresolutions. Now Iraq’s seat is held by a democratic \\nGovernment that embodies the aspirations of the Iraqi \\npeople, represented today by President Talabani. With \\nthese changes, more than 50 million people have been \\ngiven a voice in this Hall for the first time in decades. \\n Some of the changes in the Middle East are \\nhappening gradually, but they are real. Algeria has held \\nits first competitive presidential election, and the \\nmilitary remained neutral. The United Arab Emirates \\nrecently announced that half of its seats in the Federal \\nNational Council will be chosen by elections. Kuwait \\nheld elections in which women were allowed to vote \\nand run for office for the first time. Citizens have voted \\nin municipal elections in Saudi Arabia, in \\nparliamentary elections in Jordan and Bahrain and in \\nmultiparty presidential elections in Yemen and in \\nEgypt. These are important steps, and the Governments \\nshould continue to move forward with other reforms \\nthat show that they trust their people. Every nation that \\ntravels the road to freedom moves at a different pace, \\nand the democracies they build will reflect their own \\ncultures and traditions. But the destination is the same: \\na free society where people live at peace with each \\nother and at peace with the world. \\n Some have argued that the democratic changes \\nwe are seeing in the Middle East are destabilizing the \\nregion. This argument rests on a false assumption: that \\nthe Middle East was stable to begin with. The reality is \\nthat the stability we thought we saw in the Middle East \\nwas a mirage. For decades, millions of men and women \\nin the region have been trapped in oppression and \\nhopelessness. And these conditions left a generation \\ndisillusioned and made this region a breeding ground \\nfor extremism. \\n Imagine what it is like to be a young person \\nliving in a country that is not moving toward reform. \\nYou are 21 years old, and while your peers in other \\nparts of the world are casting their ballots for the first \\ntime, you are powerless to change the course of your \\nGovernment. While your peers in other parts of the \\nworld have received educations that prepare them for \\nthe opportunities of a global economy, you have been \\nfed propaganda and conspiracy theories that blame \\nothers for your country’s shortcomings. And \\neverywhere you turn, you hear extremists who tell you \\nthat you can escape your misery and regain your \\ndignity through violence and terror and martyrdom. For \\nmany across the broader Middle East, this is the dismal \\nchoice presented every day. \\n Every civilized nation, including those in the \\nMuslim world, must support those in the region who \\nare offering a more hopeful alternative. We know that \\nwhen people have a voice in their future they are less \\nlikely to blow themselves up in suicide attacks. We \\nknow that when leaders are accountable to their people, \\nthey are more likely to seek national greatness in the \\nachievements of their citizens, rather than in terror and \\nconquest. So we must stand with democratic leaders \\nand moderate reformers across the broader Middle \\nEast. We must give voice to the hopes of decent men \\nand women who want for their children the same things \\nwe want for ours. We must seek stability through a free \\nand just Middle East where the extremists are \\nmarginalized by millions of citizens in control of their \\nown destinies. \\n Today, I would like to speak directly to the \\npeople across the broader Middle East. My country \\ndesires peace. Extremists in your midst spread \\npropaganda claiming that the West is engaged in a war \\nagainst Islam. This propaganda is false, and its purpose \\nis to confuse you and justify acts of terror. We respect \\nIslam, but we will protect our people from those who \\npervert Islam to sow death and destruction. Our goal is \\nto help you build a more tolerant and hopeful society \\nthat honours people of all faiths and promotes peace. \\n To the people of Iraq: nearly 12 million of you \\nbraved the car bombers and assassins last December to \\nvote in free elections. The world saw you hold up \\npurple ink-stained fingers, and your courage filled us \\nwith admiration. You have stood firm in the face of \\nhorrendous acts of terror and sectarian violence, and \\nwe will not abandon you in your struggle to build a \\nfree nation. America and our coalition partners will \\ncontinue to stand with the democratic Government you \\nelected. We will continue to help you secure the \\ninternational assistance and investment you need to \\ncreate jobs and opportunity, working with the United \\nNations and through the International Compact with \\nIraq endorsed here in New York yesterday. We will \\ncontinue to train those of you who stepped forward to \\nfight the enemies of freedom. We will not yield the \\nfuture of your country to terrorists and extremists. In \\nreturn, your leaders must rise to the challenges your \\ncountry is facing and make difficult choices to bring \\nsecurity and prosperity. Working together, we will help \\n  \\n \\n06-52731 10 \\n \\nyour democracy succeed, so that it can become a \\nbeacon of hope for millions in the Muslim world. \\n To the people of Afghanistan: together, we \\noverthrew the Taliban regime that brought misery into \\nyour lives and harboured terrorists who brought death \\nto the citizens of many nations. Since then, we have \\nwatched you choose your leaders in free elections and \\nbuild a democratic Government. You can be proud of \\nthese achievements. We respect your courage and your \\ndetermination to live in peace and freedom. We will \\ncontinue to stand with you to defend your democratic \\ngains. \\n Today, forces from more than 40 countries, \\nincluding members of the NATO alliance, are bravely \\nserving side by side with you against the extremists \\nwho want to bring down the free Government you have \\nestablished. We will help you defeat these enemies and \\nbuild a free Afghanistan that will never again oppress \\nyou or be a safe haven for terrorists. \\n To the people of Lebanon: last year, you inspired \\nthe world when you came out into the streets to \\ndemand your independence from Syrian dominance. \\nYou drove Syrian forces from your country and you \\nre-established democracy. Since then, you have been \\ntested by the fighting that began with Hizbollah’s \\nunprovoked attacks on Israel. Many of you have seen \\nyour homes and your communities caught in crossfire. \\nWe see your suffering, and the world is helping you to \\nrebuild your country and helping you deal with the \\narmed extremists who are undermining your \\ndemocracy by acting as a State within a State. \\n The United Nations has passed a good resolution \\nthat has authorized an international force, led by \\nFrance and Italy, to help you restore Lebanese \\nsovereignty over Lebanese soil. For many years, \\nLebanon was a model of democracy and pluralism and \\nopenness in the region — and it will be again. \\n To the people of Iran: the United States respects \\nyou. We respect your country. We admire your rich \\nhistory, your vibrant culture and your many \\ncontributions to civilization. You deserve an \\nopportunity to determine your own future, an economy \\nthat rewards your intelligence and your talents and a \\nsociety that allows you to fulfil your tremendous \\npotential. The greatest obstacle to this future is that \\nyour rulers have chosen to deny you liberty and to use \\nyour nation’s resources to fund terrorism, and fuel \\nextremism, and pursue nuclear weapons. \\n The United Nations has passed a clear resolution \\nrequiring that the regime in Tehran meet its \\ninternational obligations. Iran must abandon its nuclear \\nweapons ambitions. Despite what the regime tells you, \\nwe have no objection to Iran’s pursuit of a truly \\npeaceful nuclear power programme. We are working \\ntoward a diplomatic solution to this crisis, and as we \\ndo, we look to the day when you can live in freedom \\nand America and Iran can be good friends and close \\npartners in the cause of peace. \\n To the people of Syria: your land is home to a \\ngreat people with a proud tradition of learning and \\ncommerce. Today your rulers have allowed your \\ncountry to become a crossroad for terrorism. In your \\nmidst, Hamas and Hizbollah are working to destabilize \\nthe region, and your Government is turning your \\ncountry into a tool of Iran. This is increasing your \\ncountry’s isolation from the world. Your Government \\nmust choose a better way forward by ending its support \\nfor terror, and living in peace with your neighbours, \\nand opening the way to a better life for you and your \\nfamilies. \\n To the people of Darfur: you have suffered \\nunspeakable violence, and my nation has called these \\natrocities what they are: genocide. For the last two \\nyears, America joined with the international \\ncommunity to provide emergency food aid and support \\nfor an African Union peacekeeping force. Yet your \\nsuffering continues. The world must step forward to \\nprovide additional humanitarian aid, and we must \\nstrengthen the African Union force that has done good \\nwork but is not strong enough to protect you. The \\nSecurity Council has approved a resolution that would \\ntransform the African Union force into a blue-helmeted \\nforce that is larger and more robust. To increase its \\nstrength and effectiveness, NATO nations should \\nprovide logistics and other support. The regime in \\nKhartoum is stopping the deployment of this force. If \\nthe Sudanese Government does not approve this \\npeacekeeping force quickly, the United Nations must \\nact. Your lives and the credibility of the United Nations \\nare at stake. So today I am announcing that I am \\nnaming a presidential Special Envoy — former \\nAdministrator of the United States Agency for \\nInternational Development, Andrew Natsios — to lead \\nAmerica’s efforts to resolve the outstanding disputes \\nand help bring peace to your land. \\n The world must also stand up for peace in the \\nHoly Land. I am committed to two democratic States, \\n \\n \\n11 06-52731 \\n \\nIsrael and Palestine, living side by side in peace and \\nsecurity. I am committed to a Palestinian State that has \\nterritorial integrity and will live peacefully with the \\nJewish State of Israel. This is the vision set forth in the \\nroad map, and helping the parties to reach this goal is \\none of the great objectives of my presidency. The \\nPalestinian people have suffered from decades of \\ncorruption and violence and the daily humiliation of \\noccupation. Israeli citizens have endured brutal acts of \\nterrorism and constant fear of attack since the birth of \\ntheir nation. Many brave men and women have made \\nthe commitment to peace. Yet extremists in the region \\nare stirring up hatred and trying to prevent these \\nmoderate voices from prevailing. \\n This struggle is unfolding in the Palestinian \\nterritories. Earlier this year, the Palestinian people \\nvoted in a free election. The leaders of Hamas \\ncampaigned on a platform of ending corruption and \\nimproving the lives of the Palestinian people, and they \\nprevailed. The world is waiting to see whether the \\nHamas Government will follow through on its \\npromises or pursue an extremist agenda. The world has \\nsent a clear message to the leaders of Hamas: serve the \\ninterests of the Palestinian people, abandon terror, \\nrecognize Israel’s right to exist, honour agreements and \\nwork for peace. \\n President Abbas is committed to peace and to his \\npeople’s aspirations for a State of their own. Prime \\nMinister Olmert is committed to peace, and has said he \\nintends to meet with President Abbas to make real \\nprogress on the outstanding issues between them. I \\nbelieve that peace can be achieved and that a \\ndemocratic Palestinian State is possible. I hear from \\nleaders in the region who want to help. I have directed \\nSecretary of State Rice to lead a diplomatic effort to \\nengage moderate leaders across the region to help the \\nPalestinians reform their security services and support \\nIsraeli and Palestinian leaders in their efforts to come \\ntogether to resolve their differences. \\n Prime Minister Blair has indicated that his \\ncountry will work with partners in Europe to help \\nstrengthen the governing institutions of the Palestinian \\nadministration. We welcome his initiative. Countries \\nlike Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt have made clear \\nthat they are willing to contribute the diplomatic and \\nfinancial assistance necessary to help these efforts \\nsucceed. I am optimistic that, by supporting the forces \\nof democracy and moderation, we can help Israelis and \\nPalestinians build a more hopeful future and achieve \\nthe peace in the Holy Land that we all want. \\n Freedom, by its nature, cannot be imposed; it \\nmust be chosen. From Beirut to Baghdad, people are \\nmaking the choice for freedom. And the nations \\ngathered in this Hall must make a choice as well. Will \\nwe support the moderates and reformers who are \\nworking for change across the Middle East, or will we \\nyield the future to the terrorists and extremists? \\nAmerica has made its choice: we will stand with the \\nmoderates and reformers. \\n Recently, a courageous group of Arab and \\nMuslim intellectuals wrote me a letter. In it, they said \\nthis: “The shore of reform is the only one on which any \\nlights appear, even though the journey demands \\ncourage, patience and perseverance”. The United \\nNations was created to make that journey possible. \\nTogether we must support the dreams of good and \\ndecent people who are working to transform a troubled \\nregion. And by doing so, we will advance the high \\nideals on which this institution was founded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n","5951  Thank you for the opportunity \\nto address the General Assembly of the United Nations.  \\n Sixty years ago, representatives from 16 nations \\ngathered to begin deliberations on a new international \\nbill of rights. The document they produced is called the \\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, and it stands \\nas a landmark achievement in the history of human \\nliberty. The Declaration opens by recognizing the \\ninherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of \\nall members of the human family as the foundation of \\nfreedom and justice and peace in the world. As we \\ngather for the sixty-second session of the General \\nAssembly, the standards of the Declaration must guide \\nour work in this world.  \\n Achieving the promise of the Declaration requires \\nconfronting long-term threats. It also requires \\nanswering the immediate needs of today. \\n We nations in this Hall have our differences. Yet, \\nthere are some areas where we can all agree. When \\ninnocent people are trapped in a life of murder and \\nfear, the Declaration is not being upheld. When \\nmillions of children starve to death or perish from a \\nmosquito bite, we are not doing our duty in the world. \\nWhen whole societies are cut off from the prosperity of \\nthe global economy, we are all worse off. Changing \\nthese underlying conditions is what the Declaration \\ncalls the work of larger freedom, and it must be the \\nwork of every nation in this Assembly. \\n This great institution must work for great \\npurposes, to free people from tyranny and violence, \\nhunger and disease, illiteracy and ignorance and \\npoverty and despair. Every member of the United \\nNations must join in this mission of liberation. The \\nfirst mission of the United Nations requires liberating \\npeople from tyranny and violence. The first article of \\nthe Universal Declaration begins by stating that all \\nhuman beings are born free and equal in dignity and \\nrights. This truth is denied by terrorists and extremists \\nwho kill the innocent with the aim of imposing their \\nhateful vision on humanity. The followers of this \\nviolent ideology are a threat to civilized people \\neverywhere. All civilized nations must work together \\nto stop them by sharing intelligence about their \\nnetworks and choking off their finances and bringing to \\njustice their operatives. In the long run, the best way to \\ndefeat extremists is to defeat their dark ideology with a \\nmore hopeful vision   the vision of liberty that \\nfounded this body. \\n The United States salutes the nations that have \\nrecently taken strides towards liberty, including \\nUkraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Mauritania, Liberia, \\nSierra Leone and Morocco. The Palestinian territories \\nhave moderate leaders   mainstream leaders   who \\nare working to build free institutions that fight terror, \\nenforce the law and respond to the needs of their \\npeople. The international community must support \\nthese leaders so that we can advance the vision of two \\ndemocratic States   Israel and Palestine   living side \\nby side in peace and security. \\n Brave citizens in Lebanon and Afghanistan and \\nIraq have made the choice for democracy. Yet, the \\nextremists have responded by targeting them for \\nmurder. This is not a show of strength; it is evidence of \\nfear; and the extremists are doing everything within \\ntheir power to bring down these young democracies. \\nThe people of Lebanon and Afghanistan and Iraq have \\nasked for our help, and every civilized nation has a \\nresponsibility to stand with them. Every civilized \\nnation also has a responsibility to stand up for the \\npeople suffering under dictatorship. In Belarus, North \\nKorea, Syria and Iran, brutal regimes deny their people \\nthe fundamental rights enshrined in the Universal \\nDeclaration. \\n Americans are outraged by the situation in \\nBurma, where a military junta has imposed a 19-year \\nreign of fear. Basic freedoms of speech, assembly and \\nworship are severely restricted. Ethnic minorities are \\npersecuted. Forced child labour, human trafficking and \\nrape are common. The regime is holding more than \\n1,000 political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, \\nwhose party was elected overwhelmingly by the \\nBurmese people in 1990. \\n The ruling junta remains unyielding, yet the \\npeople’s desire for freedom is unmistakable. This \\nmorning, I am announcing a series of steps to help \\nbring peaceful change to Burma. The United States will \\ntighten economic sanctions on the leaders of the \\nregime and their financial backers. We will impose an \\nexpanded visa ban on those responsible for the most \\negregious violations of human rights   as well as their \\nfamily members. We will continue to support the \\nefforts of humanitarian groups working to alleviate \\nsuffering in Burma. And I urge the United Nations and \\nall nations to use their diplomatic and economic \\nleverage to help the Burmese people reclaim their \\nfreedom. \\n In Cuba, the long rule of a cruel dictator is \\nnearing its end. The Cuban people are ready for their \\nfreedom. And as that nation enters a period of \\ntransition, the United Nations must insist on free \\nspeech, free assembly and, ultimately, free and \\ncompetitive elections. \\n In Zimbabwe, ordinary citizens suffer under a \\ntyrannical regime. The Government has cracked down \\non peaceful calls for reform and has forced millions to \\nflee their homeland. The behaviour of the Mugabe \\nregime is an assault on its people and an affront to the \\nprinciples of the Universal Declaration. The United \\nNations must insist on change in Harare and must insist \\non freedom for the people of Zimbabwe. \\n In Sudan, innocent civilians are suffering \\nrepression; and in the Darfur region, many are losing \\ntheir lives to genocide. America has responded with \\ntough sanctions against those responsible for the \\nviolence. We have provided more than $2 billion in \\nhumanitarian and peacekeeping aid. I look forward to \\nattending a Security Council meeting that will focus on \\nDarfur, chaired by the French President. I appreciate \\nFrance’s leadership in helping to stabilize Sudan’s \\nneighbours. The United Nations must answer this \\nchallenge to conscience and live up to its promise to \\npromptly deploy peacekeeping forces to Darfur. \\n Secondly, the mission of the United Nations \\nrequires liberating people from hunger and disease. \\nArticle 25 of the Universal Declaration states that \\neveryone has the right to a standard of living adequate \\nfor the health and well-being of himself and of his \\nfamily, including food, clothing, housing, and medical \\ncare. Around the world, the United Nations is carrying \\nout noble efforts to live up to these words. \\n Feeding the hungry has long been a special \\ncalling for my nation. Today, more than half the \\nworld’s food assistance comes from America. We send \\nemergency food stocks to starving people, from camps \\nin Sudan to slums around the world. I have proposed \\nan innovative initiative to alleviate hunger under which \\nAmerica would purchase the crops of local farmers in \\nAfrica and elsewhere, rather than shipping in food \\nfrom the developed world. This would help build up \\nlocal agriculture and break the cycle of famine in the \\ndeveloping world, and I urge our United States \\nCongress to support this initiative. \\n Many in this Hall are bringing the spirit of \\ngenerosity to fighting HIV/AIDS and malaria. Five \\nyears ago, in sub-Saharan Africa, an AIDS diagnosis \\nwas widely considered a death sentence, and fewer \\nthan 50,000 people infected with the virus were \\nreceiving treatment. The world responded by creating \\nthe Global Fund, which is working with Governments \\nand the private sector to fight the disease around the \\nworld. The United States decided to take these efforts a \\nstep further by launching the $15 billion Emergency \\nPlan for AIDS Relief. Since 2003, this effort has \\nhelped bring cutting-edge medicines to more than a \\nmillion people in sub-Saharan Africa. It is a good start. \\nSo earlier this year, I proposed to double our initial \\ncommitment   to $30 billion. By coming together, the \\nworld can turn the tide against HIV/AIDS, once and for \\nall. \\n Malaria is another common killer. In some \\ncountries, malaria takes as many lives as HIV/AIDS, \\nthe vast majority of them children under the age of \\nfive. Every one of these deaths is unnecessary, because \\nthe disease is preventable and treatable. The world \\nknows what it takes to stop malaria   bed nets, indoor \\nspraying and medicine to treat the disease. Two years \\nago, America launched a $1.2 billion malaria initiative. \\nOther nations and the private sector are making vital \\ncontributions as well. I call on every Member State to \\nmaintain its focus, to find new ways to join this cause \\nand to bring us closer to the day when deaths caused by \\nmalaria are no more. \\n Thirdly, the mission of the United Nations \\nrequires liberating people from the chains of illiteracy \\nand ignorance. Article 26 of the Universal Declaration \\nstates that everyone has the right to education. When \\nnations make the investments needed to educate their \\npeople, the whole world benefits. Better education \\nunleashes the talent and potential of citizens and adds \\nto the prosperity of all of us. Better education promotes \\nbetter health and greater independence. Better \\neducation increases the strength of democracy and \\nweakens the appeal of violent ideologies. So the United \\nStates is joining with nations around the world to help \\nthem provide a better education for their people. \\n A good education starts with good teachers. In \\npartnership with other nations, America has helped \\ntrain more than 600,000 teachers and administrators. A \\ngood education requires good textbooks. So, in \\npartnership with other nations, America has distributed \\ntens of millions of textbooks. A good education \\nrequires access to good schools. So, in partnership with \\nother nations, America is helping nations raise \\nstandards in their schools at home and providing \\nscholarships to help students come to schools in the \\nUnited States. And in all our education efforts, our \\nnation is working to expand access for women and \\ngirls so that the opportunity to get a decent education is \\nopen to all. \\n Finally, the mission of the United Nations \\nrequires liberating people from poverty and despair. \\nArticle 23 of the Universal Declaration states that \\neveryone has the right to work, to free choice of \\nemployment and to just and favourable conditions of \\nwork. In the twenty-first century, this requires ensuring \\nthat people in poor countries have the same \\nopportunity to benefit from the global economy that \\ncitizens of wealthy countries have. \\n The United Nations provides vital economic \\nassistance designed to help developing nations grow \\ntheir economies and reach their potential. The United \\nStates agrees with that position. We have dramatically \\nincreased our own development assistance, and we are \\ndelivering that aid in innovative ways. We started the \\nMillennium Challenge Account to reward nations that \\ngovern justly, fight corruption, invest in their people \\nand promote economic freedom. With this aid, we are \\nreaching out to developing nations in partnership, not \\npaternalism. And we are ensuring that our aid dollars \\nreach those who need them and achieve results. \\n In the long run, the best way to lift people out of \\npoverty is through trade and investment. A nation that \\nis open and trading with the world will create \\neconomic rewards that far exceed anything it could get \\nthrough foreign aid. During the 1990s, developing \\nnations that significantly lowered tariffs saw their per \\ncapita income grow about three times faster than other \\ndeveloping countries. Open markets ignite growth, \\nencourage investment, increase transparency, \\nstrengthen the rule of law and help countries help \\nthemselves. \\n The international community now has a historic \\nchance to open markets around the world by \\nconcluding a successful Doha Round of trade talks. A \\nsuccessful Doha outcome would mean real and \\nsubstantial openings in agriculture, goods and services, \\nand real and substantial reductions in trade-distorting \\nsubsidies. The world’s largest trading nations, \\nincluding major developing countries, have a special \\nresponsibility to make the tough political decisions to \\nreduce trade barriers. America has the wi11 and \\nflexibility to make those necessary decisions. Our \\nnegotiators are demonstrating that spirit in Geneva. I \\nurge other leaders to direct their negotiators to do the \\nsame. And I am optimistic that we can reach a good \\nDoha agreement and seize this once-in-a-generation \\nopportunity. \\n In the meantime, America wi11 continue to \\npursue agreements that open trade and investment \\nwherever we can. We recently signed free-trade \\nagreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama and South \\nKorea. These agreements embody the values of open \\nmarkets, transparent and fair regulation, respect for \\nprivate property and resolving disputes under rules of \\ninternational law. These are good agreements. They are \\nnow ready for a congressional vote, and I urge our \\nCongress to approve them as soon as possible. \\n As America works with the United Nations to \\nalleviate immediate needs, we are also coming together \\nto address longer-term challenges. Together, we are \\npreparing for pandemics that could cause death and \\nsuffering on a global scale. Together, we are working \\nto stop the proliferation of weapons of mass \\ndestruction. Together, we are confronting the \\nchallenges of energy security, environmental quality \\nand climate change. I appreciate the discussions on \\nclimate change led by the Secretary-General last night. \\nI look forward to further discussions at the meeting of \\nmajor economies in Washington later this week. \\n The goals I have outlined today cannot be \\nachieved overnight, and they cannot be achieved \\nwithout reform of this vital institution. The United \\nStates is committed to a strong and vibrant United \\nNations. Yet the American people are disappointed by \\nthe failures of the Human Rights Council. That body \\nhas been silent on repression by regimes from Havana \\nand Caracas to Pyongyang and Tehran, while focusing \\nits criticism excessively on Israel. To be credible on \\nhuman rights in the world, the United Nations must \\nfirst reform its own Human Rights Council. \\n Some have also called for reform of the structure \\nof the Security Council, including an expansion of its \\nmembership. The United States is open to this \\nprospect. We believe that Japan is well qualified for \\npermanent membership on the Security Council and \\nthat other nations should be considered as well. The \\nUnited States will listen to all good ideas, and we will \\nsupport changes to the Security Council as part of \\nbroader United Nations reform. And in all we do, I call \\non Member States to work for an institution that \\nadheres to strict ethical standards and lives up to the \\nhigh principles of the Universal Declaration. \\n With the commitment and courage of those in this \\nHall, we can build a world where people are free to \\nspeak, assemble and worship as they wish   a world \\nwhere children in every nation grow up healthy, get a \\ndecent education and look to the future with hope   a \\nworld where opportunity crosses every border. America \\nwill lead towards that vision, in which all are created \\nequal and free to pursue their dreams. That is the \\nfounding conviction of my country. It is the promise \\nthat established this body. And, with our determination, \\nit can be the future of our world.  \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n","6143  I am pleased to be here to \\naddress the General Assembly. Sixty-three years ago, \\nrepresentatives from around the world gathered in San \\nFrancisco to complete the founding of the Charter of \\nthe United Nations. They met in the shadow of a \\ndevastating war, with grave new dangers on the \\nhorizon. They agreed on a historic pledge to reaffirm \\nfaith in fundamental human rights and unite their \\nstrength to maintain international peace and security. \\nThat noble pledge has endured trying hours in United \\nNations history, and it still guides our work today.  \\n \\n \\n9 08-51570 \\n \\n Yet the ideals of the Charter are now facing a \\nchallenge as serious as any since the United Nations \\nfounding: a global movement of violent extremists. By \\ndeliberately murdering the innocent to advance their \\naims, those extremists defy the fundamental principles \\nof international order. They show contempt for all who \\nrespect life and value human dignity. They reject the \\nwords of the Bible, the Koran, the Torah or any \\nstandard of conscience of morality. They imperil the \\nvalues of justice and human rights that gave birth to the \\nUnited Nations — values that have fuelled an \\nunprecedented expansion of freedom across the world.  \\n To uphold the words of the Charter in the face of \\nthis challenge, every nation in this Hall has \\nresponsibilities. As sovereign States, we have an \\nobligation to govern responsibly and solve problems \\nbefore they spill across borders. We have an obligation \\nto prevent our territory from being used as a sanctuary \\nfor terrorism, proliferation, human trafficking and \\norganized crime. We have an obligation to respect the \\nrights and respond to the needs of our people.  \\n Multilateral organizations have responsibilities. \\nFor eight years, the nations in this Assembly have \\nworked together to confront the extremist threat. We \\nhave witnessed successes and setbacks, and through it \\nall a clear lesson has emerged. The United Nations and \\nother multilateral organizations are needed more \\nurgently than ever. To be successful, we must be \\nfocused, resolute and effective.  \\n Instead of only adopting resolutions decrying \\nterrorist acts after they occur, we must cooperate more \\nclosely to keep terrorist attacks from happening in the \\nfirst place. Instead of treating all forms of Government \\nas equally tolerable, we must actively challenge the \\nconditions of tyranny and despair that allow terror and \\nextremists to thrive. By acting together to meet the \\nfundamental challenge of our time, we can lead \\ntowards a world that is more secure, more prosperous \\nand more hopeful.  \\n In the decades ahead, the United Nations and \\nother multilateral organizations must continually \\nconfront terror. That mission requires clarity of vision. \\nWe must see the terrorists for what they are: ruthless \\nextremists who exploit the desperate, subvert the tenets \\nof a great religion and seek to impose their will on as \\nmany people as possible. Some suggest that those men \\nwould pose less of a threat if we would only leave \\nthem alone, yet their leaders make clear that no \\nconcession could ever satisfy their ambitions. Bringing \\nthe terrorists to justice does not create terrorism. It is \\nthe best way to protect our people.  \\n Multilateral organizations must respond by taking \\nan unequivocal moral stand against terrorism. No cause \\ncan justify the deliberate taking of innocent life, and \\nthe international community is nearing universal \\nagreement on this truth. The vast majority of nations in \\nthis Assembly now agree that tactics like suicide \\nbombing, hostage-taking and hijacking are never \\nlegitimate. The Security Council has adopted \\nresolutions declaring terror unlawful and requiring all \\nnations to crack down on terrorist financing. Earlier \\nthis month, the Secretary-General held a conference to \\nhighlight victims of terror, where he stated that \\nterrorism can never be justified. \\n Other multilateral organizations have spoken \\nclearly as well. The Group of 8 has declared that all \\nterrorist acts are criminal and must be universally \\ncondemned. The Secretary-General of the Organization \\nof the Islamic Conference recently spoke out against \\nsuicide bombing, which he said runs counter to the \\nteachings of Islam.  \\n The message behind those statements is \\nresolutely clear. Like slavery and piracy, terrorism has \\nno place in the modern world. Around the globe, \\nnations are turning those words into action. Members \\nof the United Nations are sharing intelligence with one \\nanother, conducting joint operations and freezing \\nterrorists’ finances. While terrorists continue to carry \\nout attacks like the terrible bombing in Islamabad last \\nweek, our joint actions have spared our citizens from \\nmany devastating blows.  \\n The brutal nature of the extremists is increasingly \\nclear and the coalition of nations confronting terrorists \\nis growing stronger. Over the past seven years, \\nAfghanistan and Iraq have been transformed from \\nregimes that actively sponsor terror to democracies that \\nfight terror. Libya has renounced its support for terror \\nand its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Nations like Saudi \\nArabia and Pakistan are actively pursuing the terrorists. \\nA few nations, regimes like Syria and Iran, continue to \\nsponsor terror, yet their numbers are growing fewer \\nand they are growing more isolated from the world.  \\n As the twenty-first century unfolds, some may be \\ntempted to assume that the threat has receded. That \\nwould be comforting. It would be wrong. The terrorists \\nbelieve time is on their side, so they have made waiting \\n  \\n \\n08-51570 10 \\n \\nout civilized nations part of their strategy. We must not \\nallow them to succeed. The nations of this body must \\nstand united in the fight against terror. We must \\ncontinue working to deny the terrorists refuge \\nanywhere in the world, including ungoverned spaces. \\nWe must remain vigilant against proliferation by fully \\nimplementing the terms of resolution 1540 (2004) and \\nenforcing sanctions against North Korea and Iran. We \\nmust not relent until our people are safe from this \\nthreat to civilization. \\n To uphold the Charter’s promise of peace and \\nsecurity in the twenty-first century, we must also \\nconfront the ideology of the terrorists. At its core, the \\nstruggle against extremists is a battle of ideas. \\nTerrorists envision a world in which religious freedom \\nis denied, women are oppressed and all dissent is \\ncrushed. The nations represented in this Hall must \\npresent a more hopeful alternative — a vision where \\npeople can speak freely, worship as they choose and \\npursue their dreams in liberty.  \\n Advancing this vision of freedom serves our \\nhighest ideals, as expressed in the United Nations \\nCharter’s commitment to the dignity and worth of the \\nhuman person. Advancing this vision also serves our \\nsecurity interests. History shows that when citizens \\nhave a voice in choosing their own leaders, they are \\nless likely to search for meaning in radical ideologies, \\nand when Governments respect the rights of their \\npeople, they are more likely to respect the rights of \\ntheir neighbours. \\n For all these reasons, the nations of this body \\nmust challenge tyranny as vigorously as we challenge \\nterror. Some question whether people in certain parts of \\nthe world actually desire freedom. This self-serving \\ncondescension has been disproved before our eyes. \\nFrom the voting booths of Afghanistan, Iraq and \\nLiberia to the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, the Rose \\nRevolution in Georgia, the Cedar Revolution in \\nLebanon and the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan, we \\nhave seen people consistently make the courageous \\ndecision to demand their liberty. \\n For all the suggestions to the contrary, the truth is \\nthat, whenever and wherever people are given the \\nchoice, they choose freedom. Nations represented in \\nthis Hall have supported the efforts of dissidents, \\nreformers and civil society advocates in newly free \\nsocieties through the new United Nations Democracy \\nFund, and we appreciate those efforts. As young \\ndemocracies around the world continue to make brave \\nstands for liberty, multilateral organizations like the \\nUnited Nations must continue to stand with them. \\n In Afghanistan, a determined people are working \\nto overcome decades of tyranny and protect their newly \\nfree society. They have strong support from all 26 \\nnations of the NATO alliance. I appreciate the United \\nNations decision this week to renew the mandate of the \\nInternational Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. \\nThe United Nations also has an active civilian presence \\nin Afghanistan, where experts are doing important \\nwork helping to improve education, facilitate \\nhumanitarian aid and protect human rights. We must \\ncontinue to help the Afghan people defend their young \\ndemocracy so that the Taliban does not return to power \\nand Afghanistan is never again a safe haven for terror. \\n In Iraq, the fight has been difficult, yet daily life \\nhas improved dramatically over the past 20 months \\nthanks to the courage of the Iraqi people, a determined \\ncoalition of nations and a surge of American troops. \\nThe United Nations has provided the mandate for \\nmultinational forces in Iraq through this December, and \\nthe United Nations is carrying out an ambitious \\nstrategy to strengthen Iraq’s democracy, including \\nhelping Iraqis prepare for their next round of free \\nelections. Whatever disagreements our nations have \\nhad on Iraq, we should all welcome this progress \\ntowards stability and peace and we should stand united \\nin helping Iraq’s democracy succeed.  \\n We must stand united in our support of other \\nyoung democracies, from the people of Lebanon \\nstruggling to maintain their hard-won independence to \\nthe people of the Palestinian territories, who deserve a \\nfree and peaceful State of their own. We must stand \\nunited in our support of the people of Georgia. The \\nUnited Nations Charter sets forth the equal rights of \\nnations large and small; Russia’s invasion of Georgia \\nwas a violation of those rights. Young democracies \\naround the world are watching to see how we respond \\nto this test. The United States has worked with allies in \\nsuch multilateral institutions as the European Union \\nand NATO to uphold Georgia’s territorial integrity and \\nprovide humanitarian relief. Our nations will continue \\nto support Georgia’s democracy. \\n In this Hall are representatives of Georgia, \\nUkraine, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Liberia, Iraq and other \\nbrave young democracies. We admire their courage, we \\nhonour their sacrifices, and we thank them for their \\n \\n \\n11 08-51570 \\n \\ninspiring example. We will continue to stand with all \\nwho stand for freedom. This noble goal is worthy of \\nthe United Nations and it should have the support of \\nevery member of this Assembly.  \\n Extending the reach of political freedom is \\nessential to prevailing in the great struggle of our time, \\nbut it is not enough. Many in this Hall have answered \\nthe call to help their brothers and sisters in need by \\nworking to alleviate hopelessness. Those efforts to \\nimprove the human condition honour the highest ideals \\nof this institution. They also advance our security \\ninterests. The extremists find their most fertile \\nrecruiting grounds in societies trapped in chaos and \\ndespair — places where people see no prospect of a \\nbetter life. In the shadows of hopelessness, radicalism \\nthrives. Eventually, that radicalism can boil over into \\nviolence, cross borders and take innocent lives across \\nthe world.  \\n Overcoming hopelessness requires addressing its \\ncauses: poverty, disease and ignorance. Challenging \\nthese conditions is in the interest of every nation in this \\nHall, and democracies are particularly well positioned \\nto carry out that work because we have experience \\nresponding to the needs of our own people. We are \\nnatural partners in helping other nations respond to the \\nneeds of theirs. Together, we must commit our \\nresources and efforts to advancing education, health \\nand prosperity.  \\n Over the years, many nations have made well-\\nintentioned efforts to promote these goals, but the \\nsuccess of these efforts must be measured by more than \\nintentions. It must be measured by results. My nation is \\nplacing insistence on results at the heart of our foreign \\nassistance programmes. We launched a new initiative, \\ncalled the Millennium Challenge Account, which \\ndirects our help to countries that demonstrate their \\nability to produce results by governing justly, fighting \\ncorruption and pursuing market-based economic \\npolicies, as well as investing in their people. Every \\ncountry and institution that provides foreign assistance, \\nincluding the United Nations, will be more effective by \\nshowing faith in the people of the developing world \\nand insisting on performance in return for aid.  \\n Experience also shows that, to be effective, we \\nmust adopt a model of partnership, not paternalism. \\nThis approach is based on our conviction that people in \\nthe developing world have the capacity to improve \\ntheir own lives and will rise to meet high expectations \\nif we set them. America sought to apply this model in \\nour Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Every nation that \\nreceives American support through this initiative \\ndevelops its own plan for fighting HIV/AIDS and \\nmeasures the results.  \\n So far, these results are inspiring. Five years ago, \\n50,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving \\ntreatment for HIV/AIDS; today, that number is nearly \\n1.7 million. We are taking a similar approach to \\nfighting malaria, and so far we have supported local \\nefforts to protect more than 25 million Africans. \\nMultilateral organizations have made bold \\ncommitments of their own to fight disease. The G-8 \\nhas pledged to match America’s efforts on malaria and \\nHIV/AIDS. Through the Global Fund, many countries \\nare working to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria and \\ntuberculosis. Lives in the developing world depend on \\nthese programmes, and all who have made pledges to \\nfight disease have an obligation to follow through on \\ntheir commitments.  \\n One of the most powerful engines of development \\nand prosperity are trade and investment, which create \\nnew opportunities for entrepreneurs, help people rise \\nout of poverty and reinforce such fundamental values \\nas transparency and the rule of law. For all these \\nreasons, many represented in this Hall have conducted \\nfree-trade agreements at the bilateral and regional \\nlevels.  \\n The most effective step of all would be an \\nagreement that tears down trade barriers at the global \\nlevel. The recent impasse in the Doha round is \\ndisappointing, but that does not have to be the final \\nword. I urge every nation to seize this opportunity to \\nlift up economies around the world and reach a \\nsuccessful Doha agreement as soon as possible. \\nBeyond Doha, our nations must renew our commitment \\nto open economies and stand firm against economic \\nisolationism. These objectives are being tested by \\nturbulence in the global financial markets.  \\n Our economies are more closely connected than \\never before, and I know that many of you here are \\nwatching how the United States Government will \\naddress the problems in our financial system. In recent \\nweeks we have taken bold steps to prevent a severe \\ndisruption of the American economy, which would \\nhave a devastating effect on other economies around \\nthe world. We promote stability in the markets by \\npreventing the disorderly failure of major companies. \\n  \\n \\n08-51570 12 \\n \\nThe Federal Reserve has injected urgently needed \\nliquidity into the system. Last week, I announced \\ndecisive action by the federal Government to address \\nthe root cause of much of the instability in our \\nfinancial markets by purchasing illiquid assets that are \\nweighing down balance sheets and restricting the flow \\nof credit. I can assure the Assembly that my \\nAdministration and our Congress are working together \\nto quickly pass legislation approving this strategy. And \\nI am confident that we will act in the urgent time frame \\nrequired.  \\n The objectives I have laid out for multilateral \\ninstitutions confronting terror, opposing tyranny and \\npromoting effective development are difficult, but they \\nare necessary tasks. To have maximum impact, \\nmultilateral institutions must take on challenging \\nmissions, and like all of us in this Hall they must work \\ntowards measurable goals, be accountable for their \\nactions and hold true to their word.  \\n In the twenty-first century, the world needs a \\ncompetent and effective United Nations. This unique \\ninstitution should build on its successes and improve \\nits performance. Where there is inefficiency and \\ncorruption, that must be corrected. Where there are \\nbloated bureaucracies, they must be streamlined. \\nWhere Members fail to uphold their obligations, there \\nmust be strong action — for example, there should be \\nan immediate review of the Human Rights Council, \\nwhich has routinely protected violators of human \\nrights. There should be a stronger effort to help the \\npeople of Burma live free of the repression they have \\nsuffered for too long. All nations, especially members \\nof the Security Council, must act decisively to ensure \\nthat the Government of the Sudan upholds its \\ncommitment to address the violence in Darfur. \\n The United Nations is an Organization of \\nextraordinary potential. As it rebuilds its Headquarters, \\nit must also open the door to a new age of \\ntransparency, accountability and seriousness of \\npurpose. With determination and clear purpose, the \\nUnited Nations can be a powerful force for good as we \\nhead into the twenty-first century. It can affirm the \\ngreat promise of its founding.  \\n In the final days of the San Francisco Conference, \\nthe delegates negotiating the United Nations Charter \\nreceived a visit from President Harry Truman. He \\nacknowledged the enormous challenges they faced and \\nsaid that success was possible only because of what he \\ncalled an unshakable unity of determination. Today, the \\nworld is engaged in another period of great challenge, \\nand by continuing to work together, that unshakable \\nunity of determination will be ours. Together we can \\nconfront and defeat the evil of terrorism. Together we \\ncan secure the Almighty’s gift of liberty and justice to \\nmillions who have not known it. Together we can build \\na world that is freer, safer and better for the \\ngenerations who follow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n","\n","      length  \n","2720  19779   \n","3038  15555   \n","4814  14724   \n","5002  16684   \n","5191  16962   \n","5382  18628   \n","5760  16675   \n","5951  15483   \n","6143  18384   "]},"execution_count":87,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["pd.set_option(\"display.max_colwidth\", -1)\n","df[df['speaker'].str.contains('Bush')] ### print the full text for entries that contain 'Bush' as speaker"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"MBcALTZmIE6i","outputId":"ee044286-c62a-4934-d37e-d931e51c3c33"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["2720    Bush              \n","3038    George Bush       \n","4814    George W.

Garba of Nigeria on his unanimous election to the important post of President of the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are confident that under his able leadership the challenging work before the Assembly will be carried to its conclusion with efficiency and success. I should also like to register Papua New Guinea's sincere appreciation of the excellent job accomplished by his predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina.\\nIn addition, let me add my Government's voice to the voices of those who have already spoken in praise of the commendable work being done by the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, and his staff in implementing United Nations programmes. Papua New Guinea continues to regard the United Nations as having a unique role in working for the relaxation of tensions, the resolution of conflicts and the building of a strong framework for international co-operation based on mutual respect and understanding. Papua New Guinea remains committed to playing its part in contributing to achieving this objective.\\nMy delegation attends this session with the hope that we shall collectively take advantage of the opportunities before us to hasten the realization of the global environment that the founders of the United Nations envisaged for us and future generations.\\nWe have before us this year another complex agenda which, among other things, points to an international community saddled with a great number of problems. Some of these problems date back to before the United Nations was even established. Yet it is the responsibility of the Assembly to work for the resolution of those problems. The uncertainty that they cause is felt by all of us, and for many developing countries, including Papua New Guinea, has a direct impact on our development efforts. But there is still some hope and optimism. Papua New Guinea believes with a good measure of confidence that positive steps have been taken in dealing with the problems which are the subject of this session's attention.\\nMy delegation highly commends the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his tireless efforts in upholding the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. We note with considerable satisfaction his comprehensive report, which records process being made in resolving regional tensions and conflicts, among them those in Cambodia, Afghanistan, Namibia, apartheid South Africa, Western Sahara and Central America, and the Iran-Iraq conflict. The report also underscores the efforts being made to tackle other pressing issues, including the environment, disarmament, trade, finance, debt servicing and human rights.\\nOur own region, the South Pacific, is relatively free of major conflicts, but is nevertheless an area which is being given increasing attention by other countries and international organizations. The South Pacific is not immune from the effects of international tensions elsewhere and the worrying trends in the world economy.\\nThe community of the South Pacific comprises mainly small island States scattered in the vast Pacific Ocean. Our struggle is one of survival, a struggle to develop our people and national economies with the limited financial and technical resources available to us while at the same time keeping our region free of big-Power rivalry and the environment free of nuclear and other activities which could harm, if not destroy, our region's resources, including the most important source of livelihood for most island communities - fish and marine resources.\\nSince our independence in 1975 we have actively pursued the cause of decolonisation in the South Pacific. Most of our region has been decolonised, but there are some island communities whose future is still uncertain.\\nPapua New Guinea welcomes the progress being made by the Government of France in bringing political and administrative reforms to New Caledonia through the Matiqnon and other agreements signed between the French Government and the different political groups in the Territory. But we believe that the pace of change must be hastened and a clear commitment made for bringing the Territory to independence as soon as possible. Papua New Guinea regrets the tragic loss of Mr. Jean-Marie Tjibaou, President of the FLNKS, and his deputy, Mr. Yeiwene, on 4 May 1989. The deaths of the late President Tjibaou, Mr. Yeiwene and others who have championed the cause of independence in the Territory for so long and over the years made extensive representations within and outside the United Nations on behalf of their Territory, and who were among those who signed the Matignon agreements, show that more needs to be done by the Government of France to bring about changes 'which conform with the aspirations of the people of New Caledonia, especially the indigenous Kanaks.\\nBoth these leaders were men of great vision, strength and wisdom They made great sacrifices for the indigenous Melanesian people of New Caledonia. We pay tribute to then, and we know that their just struggle will not end.\\nNew Caledonia is on the United Nations list of Non-Self Governing Territories, following a decision of the Assembly in December 1986. The Assembly therefore has a continuing responsibility to monitor developments in the Territory closely. The Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, this year 'Strongly urged that the question of New Caledonia be kept under active consideration at the United Nations until the conditions for an internationally acceptable act of self-determination, in accordance with the principles and practices of the United Nations, have been met'. We also hope that the Administering Authority, in France, will comply fully with all its obligations as provided for in the United Nations Charter, and with General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV).\\nPapua New Guinea has also welcomed recent progress made under the Compact arrangements between the United States and the Micronesian islands. We have moved forward in establishing diplomatic relations with the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Marshall Islands. But we also look forward to the resolution of the outstanding issues affecting Palau's political future.\\nIn the South Pacific, Papua New Guinea is equally concerned about protection of the environment. On 10 August this year, Papua New Guinea ratified two important treaties which seek to protect our environment - namely, the South\\nPacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty and the Convention for the Protection of the Environment and Resources of the South Pacific. Taken as a package together with fisheries and other economic arrangements that are being progressively put in place, they represent important corner-stones for the protection of the environment in the South Pacific region, and for the management and development of its vast marine resources in accordance with the interests of the island communities. My Government intends to work closely with our partners in the South Pacific to fully implement these treaty arrangements, and, like those partners, we shall strongly - and especially oppose, France's continued nuclear-testing programme at Mururoa Atoll and all the other activities that are harmful to the resources and livelihood of our people.\\nSuch regional initiatives deserve the full and active support of the United Nations. They form part of the wider international concern about, and the action now being taken to protect, the global environment.\\nThe Government of Papua New Guinea applauds the decision of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China to ratify two of the three Protocols to the South Pacific nuclear-free-zone Treaty. We strongly urge other nuclear-weapons States, including France, the United Kingdom and the United States, to ratify the Protocols and respect the operations of this Treaty and other environmental arrangements in the South Pacific.\\nIn regional fisheries, a successful regional fisheries agreement between the United States and the countries members of the South Pacific Forum,, signed in 1987, is already contributing to the development of our fisheries resources. We are prepared to enter into similar arrangements with other major fishing nations, on the basis of fair and equitable returns for island States and principles designed to protect and carefully manage the fisheries resources and our environment. We urge the Government of Jap* to co-operate in unlocking the stalled negotiations on a regional fisheries arrangement with island States.\\nConsistent with the declaration made in July this year by the leaders of the South Pacific Forum, we also call on Japan and other distant-water-fishing nations to cease completely the harmful method of qill-net fishing often referred to as the 'wall of death' in the South Pacific. We are convinced that such a destructive and indiscriminate fishing practice will, if not halted, increasingly diminish our peoples* opportunities and chances not only of a livelihood but of survival in the future.\\nFisheries, trade development, transport and communications are among the major economic activities being pursued by island States and regional organizations established within the region, in our efforts to improve the welfare of our people and strengthen our wider connections with the international community. Papua New Guinea strongly supports the work of regional organizations in the South Pacific as well as other international agencies, including United Nations agencies, which collaborate closely with them in bringing development to our region.\\nPapua New Guinea's interest extends beyond the South Pacific region. Our foreign policy seeks to expand and diversify relationships with countries Members of the United Nations. Significant progress is already being made towards this commitment in the Asian region.\\nWe highly value our growing links with the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN is an impressive regional organization, which continues to promote understanding and co-operation in the South-East Asian region and elsewhere, through, among other things, the taking of constructive regional initiatives on issues such as Cambodia. Papua New Guinea has special observer statue at annual meetings off ASSAM foreign ministers. We are pleased that our relationship with ASEAN has been further strengthened this year through Papua Hew Guinea's accession on ? July 1989 to the Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation in South-East Asia.\\nAs I said earlier the agenda for this session is a complex one. A significant number of items quite rightly deal with initiatives to reduce international tensions and to promote the cause of peace and security. Papua New Guinea strongly supports international efforts to reduce tensions and the number of conflicts.\\nWe especially commend the leaderships in Moscow and in Washington. They have in recent years worked with a deep sense of commitment towards reducing international tensions, and we welcome their further commitment at this session to eliminate chemical weapons. We commend their efforts on disarmament. But we urge them to go even further. \\nTheir efforts in particular contributed to the climate of optimism that became evident at last year's session of the General Assembly, and have contributed to the maintenance of that climate this year. Their efforts and those of others, particularly members of the Security Council, must be supported if there is to be any further meaningful progress in the solution of problems in Cambodia, Afghanistan, the Middle East, the Korean peninsula, Namibia and southern Africa.\\nPapua New Guinea welcomes signals off Vietnamese troop withdrawals from Cambodia and hopes that the commitment this entails will be fulfilled, including free elections supervised by the United Nations, and that the people off Cambodia will reassert their identity and return to democracy, peace and tranquillity, and socio-economic progress.\\nThe situation in the Korean peninsula is also of concern to my Government. At independence, Papua New Guinea established formal diplomatic ties with both the Republic of Korea sad the Democratic Republic of Korea. Our links with the Republic of Korea have developed more rapidly. But our commitment is to support initiatives by both Koreas for the peaceful reunification of their people. Papua New Guinea urges the Governments of both Koreas to maintain active dialogue in working for understanding, reconciliation and efforts to achieve the peaceful unification of the Korean people. We note with great interest the proposals contained in fee address of President Roh Tae Wco on 11 September 1989 concerning national unification. The declaration, we believe, sets a constructive has is for discussions which could lead to early reunification. I reiterate again that fee Government of Papua New Guinea supports the admission of both North and South Korea as full Members of fee United Nations. Their admission, we believe, has fee potential to open up additional avenues towards dialogue, co-operation and understanding.\\nPapua New Guinea continues to believe that efforts Made to address the underlying causes of tension and conflict in the Middle East oust continue. My Government commends the parties - including the United Nations - involved in this important process. Papua New Guinea reaffirms its belief that the Palestinians have a right to a homeland just as much as Israel has a right to exist within secured borders. Those two conditions are fundamental to any lasting resolution of the tensions and conflicts in the Middle East. The problem of apartheid and the related colonial situation imposed by the racist regime of South Africa still exist in spite of numerous efforts by this body and other United Nations agencies. Papua New Guinea is of the firm belief that the option of mandatory sanctions against South Africa holds good prospects foe success both in dismantling apartheid and in achieving the independence of Namibia.\\nWith regard to global trade and the economic developments that have taken place in the recent past, we note that the industrialized countries have moved towards structural adjustment policies to address the issues of low growth and high inflation through the liberalization of trade, the elimination of industrial and agricultural subsidies and the creation of employment opportunities. We also note that many developing countries have experienced not only slow and stagnant economic growth but debt problems as well. As a result of these continuing economic difficulties many developing countries, including Papua New Guinea, have undertaken stringent economic policies and programmes to maintain sustainable economic growth.\\nWhile there has been progress in some of those areas, Papua New Guinea, with a developing and agriculturally based economy, is concerned that the effects of protectionist pressure exercised by industrialized economies on some of our\\nstrategic agricultural export commodities have adversely influenced our national plans and efforts to achieve sustainable economic growth. It is therefore imperative that the efforts of the global community, through the United Nations and its agencies as well as the current Uruguay Round of negotiations, should be strengthened to address such trade practices and distortions in order to ensure balanced, liberalised and fair trade between the countries in the international market.\\nIn conclusion, my delegation believes that the most important and pressing issue in the world today is the question of peace and development. Peace is the pre-condition for economic development through the expansion of international co-operation. Only in an international environment of peace and stability can the economic development of all nations be enhanced. Papua New Guinea therefore attaches great importance to international efforts aimed at achieving peace, harmony and development in the world. He also fully support efforts aimed at dealing with the growing problems of trade protectionism, debt servicing and the slowing down of financial transfers to developing countries.\\nPapua New Guinea has taken note of the overwhelming support delegations have given to the need for and effectiveness of the United Nations system. While there can be some criticisms about the Organisation's ability to deal with problems affecting the international community, ray delegation believes that there are positive signs that the United Nations network of agencies has been given a chance to work. A considerable amount of momentum has developed within the United Nations in tackling and seeking solutions to some of the world's problems. We must all take full advantage of these opportunities.\\n\\n</td>\n","      <td>16872</td>\n","      <td>[behalf, government, people, papua, new, guinea, congratulate, mr, garba, nigeria, unanimous, election, important, post, president, forty-fourth, session, united, nations, general, assembly, confident, able, leadership, challenging, work, assembly, carried, conclusion, efficiency, success, like, register, papua, new, guinea's, sincere, appreciation, excellent, job, accomplished, predecessor, mr, dante, caputo, argentina, addition, let, add, government's, voice, voices, already, spoken, praise, commendable, work, done, secretary-general, mr, perez, de, cuellar, staff, implementing, united, nations, programmes, papua, new, guinea, continues, regard, united, nations, unique, role, working, relaxation, tensions, resolution, conflicts, building, strong, framework, international, co-operation, based, mutual, respect, understanding, papua, new, guinea, remains, committed, playing, part, contributing, achieving, ...]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3738</th>\n","      <td>50</td>\n","      <td>1995</td>\n","      <td>ZAF</td>\n","      <td>South Africa</td>\n","      <td>Mr. Nzo</td>\n","      <td>Minister for Foreign Affairs</td>\n","      <td>Mr. President, I wish to\\nextend to you, on behalf of the South African delegation,\\nmy sincere congratulations on your election to the\\npresidency of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\\nYour election demonstrates the high regard in which the\\ninternational community holds your country. I should also\\nlike to express our deep gratitude to your predecessor, His\\nExcellency Mr. Amara Essy, a brother from Africa and the\\nForeign Minister of Côte d’Ivoire, who presided over the\\nforty-ninth session with great wisdom. I should also like to\\nexpress to the Secretary-General, His Excellency\\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our continued confidence in\\nhis guidance of the Organization.\\nA half century ago representatives from 50 countries\\nmet at San Francisco to draft the United Nations Charter,\\nthe Declaration of Human Rights and the Statute of the\\nInternational Court of Justice. For the United Nations to\\nhave survived for a period of 50 years in an imperfect\\nworld is indeed a milestone and a tribute to the visionary\\nsteps taken half a century ago towards the creation of a\\nbetter world.\\nSouth Africa’s involvement with the United Nations\\ngoes back to the very conception and birth of this\\nillustrious body. The then-Prime Minister of South Africa,\\nField Marshal J. C. Smuts, helped to draft the Preamble\\nto the Charter of the United Nations. In the Preamble\\nmany lofty ideas were expressed, among which were the\\nfollowing:\\n“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in\\nthe dignity and worth of the human person, in the\\nequal rights of men and women and of nations large\\nand small”.\\nHow ironic that those in power in South Africa since\\nthen, and until last year, acted in a precisely contrary\\nspirit. The United Nations contributed significantly in\\nbringing about change in South Africa. Through\\nperseverance and commitment, the United Nations\\nassisted us in our struggle to achieve democracy. Our\\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\\nreward is its reward. I should like again to express the\\ngratitude of both the people and the Government of South\\nAfrica for its foresight and courage.\\nJust over a year ago, on 23 June 1994 to be precise,\\nI had the honour to address the Assembly on behalf of the\\npeople and the Government of the Republic of South\\nAfrica. On that occasion, which marked South Africa’s\\nresumption of its participation in the work of the General\\nAssembly of the United Nations, we were filled with joy\\nand pride at the peaceful transition of South Africa into a\\nunited, non-racial, democratic and non-sexist society.\\nIn the intervening months I have travelled to many\\ncountries, visited with many foreign ministers and met with\\nseveral Heads of State or Government. We spoke of the\\nmiracle that is South Africa. We shared our thoughts and\\nexperiences on the road to that miracle. In that context, we\\ncontinue to encourage those who seek change for a better\\nlife to stand fast in their belief.\\nAs the representative of a Member of the United\\nNations, I should like to reassure you of our belief in and\\nsupport for the purposes and principles of the Charter of the\\nOrganization.\\nThe events in April 1994 in South Africa marked a\\nbreak with the past as well as a commitment to the future,\\nplacing a heavy burden on us. As a young democracy, we\\nare ready to meet the challenge. South Africa will meet this\\nchallenge with a firm commitment to the promotion of\\nnational welfare, prosperity and security, with a firm\\ncommitment to the strengthening of cooperation in the\\npursuit of the economic development and security of the\\nsouthern African subregion, with an active commitment to\\npeace, stability and good governance within the African\\nregion and elsewhere, with a firm commitment to South-\\nSouth cooperation and with a commitment to responsible\\ninternational citizenship.\\nThe Southern African Development Community\\n(SADC) was conceived in the struggle for freedom in\\nsouthern Africa and born of the courage of its leaders in\\nsetting out to create a new reality.\\nThe liberation of South Africa and the end of southern\\nAfrica’s destabilization brought great opportunities for the\\ndevelopment of our subregion. We must now translate those\\nhopes into reality. In accordance with the Abuja Treaty, we\\nmust transform the southern African region into one of the\\nreliable building blocks on which Africa’s economic\\nregeneration will be built.\\nOur greatest need today is to eradicate the scourge\\nof poverty afflicting the great mass of our people. Only\\nthen can we fulfil the dream of Africa’s liberation in the\\nhealth, happiness and well-being of its children.\\nThe mission of SADC reflects the reality that\\nsouthern Africa has long since passed the stage of\\nlamenting the privations of the past. The challenge is to\\nfind within ourselves the resources to overcome this\\nlegacy, with the cooperation of the international\\ncommunity. We need to adapt to the demands of a rapidly\\nchanging world economy and to develop the skills needed\\nto compete internationally.\\nSouth Africa’s main objective is to play a\\nconstructive role in bringing peace and stability to the\\nregion. We are totally committed to the utilization of\\npreventive diplomacy, peace-keeping and peacemaking,\\nthrough the use of regional and multilateral mechanisms.\\nIn this context, South Africa participated with others\\nin the resolution of the conflict in Lesotho and provided\\nlogistical support for the elections in Mozambique. Our\\nsupport for United Nations resolutions and actions\\nregarding Angola and the Western Sahara should also be\\nseen in that light.\\nAs an elected member of the Central Organ of the\\nConflict Resolution Mechanism of the Organization of\\nAfrican Unity (OAU) from June 1994 to June 1995, we\\nparticipated in several missions to Burundi. South Africa\\nwas part of a special four-member ministerial mission\\nelected to assess the nature and the scope of the Burundi\\nconflict with a view to encouraging and assisting the\\nBurundians to resolve their differences and end that\\nconflict. We continue to participate in the Mechanism as\\nan invited observer.\\nIn view of the desperate situation in the former\\nYugoslavia and in Rwanda, it has become imperative for\\nStates to cooperate as far as possible with the respective\\nad hoc criminal tribunals that have been created for those\\nterritories. In that regard, my country has made available\\nsome of its most talented jurists to assist.\\nThese situations have demonstrated anew the real\\nneed for the establishment of a permanent international\\ncriminal court. This issue has been revitalized in the past\\nfew years, and a window of opportunity now exists to\\nfinally bring the court into existence. It is my sincere\\nhope that significant progress will be made in that regard\\nduring this session of the General Assembly.\\n2\\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the United\\nNations, mankind is still faced with political instability,\\ndictatorship, corruption, civil war, millions of refugees and\\ninternally displaced persons, persistent economic decline\\nand continued impoverishment.\\nIn the past year, the international political climate has\\nexperienced a succession of changes which have brought\\nboth hope and a certain measure of despair to mankind.\\nHope has, however, remained a beckoning beacon bringing\\nabout a sense of confidence in the future. We were\\nsaddened by events in Somalia, but rejoiced at the transition\\nin Haiti and El Salvador. We despair at the tragedy that is\\nBosnia, yet hope that the emerging signs of a solution will\\ncome to fruition.\\nIn this spirit, allow me to congratulate the peoples of\\nIsrael and Palestine on having reached yet another landmark\\nin their journey towards a lasting settlement. We encourage\\nand support the Middle East peace process.\\nThe issues of proliferation and disarmament, in\\nparticular nuclear disarmament, are among the major\\nquestions that have been facing the international community\\nin recent times. At the historic 1995 Review and Extension\\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), all those present\\nagreed to exercise the utmost restraint pending the entry\\ninto force of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We are of the\\nview that the recent tests conducted by two nuclear-weapon\\nStates are retrogressive steps in the international\\ncommunity’s endeavour to ban nuclear testing. We believe\\nthat these tests will negatively affect the outcome of work\\non a comprehensive test-ban treaty. The South African\\nGovernment is strongly opposed to these and any further\\nnuclear tests being conducted, and calls upon those States\\nto cease testing, so as to enhance international efforts\\ntowards non-proliferation and disarmament. We call upon\\nthem to honour both the letter and the spirit of the\\nPrinciples and Objectives which they agreed to and helped\\nnegotiate at the NPT Review and Extension Conference.\\nSouth Africa has dismantled its nuclear capability. South\\nAfrica, for its part, has proven its commitment to nuclear\\ndisarmament. Now it is the turn of others to manifest a\\nsimilar commitment.\\nSouth Africa notes with great satisfaction the progress\\nachieved thus far towards the establishment of an African\\nnuclear-weapon-free zone. We have been actively involved\\nin trying to find solutions to the outstanding issues, and we\\ntrust that these hurdles can be overcome and the draft treaty\\nof Pelindaba can receive due consideration during this\\nsession of the General Assembly. The draft treaty is\\nimportant as it would expand the non-nuclear-weapon\\narea of the globe considerably and would be a further step\\ntowards the final goal of complete nuclear disarmament.\\nSouth Africa appeals to the nuclear-weapon States to\\nensure that the draft treaty is concluded and the relevant\\nprotocols signed.\\nSince the 1986 declaration of the Zone of Peace and\\nCooperation of the South Atlantic, significant progress has\\nbeen made in the political, economic, scientific, technical\\nand cultural spheres to further the objectives of the Zone.\\nOnly relatively few obstacles remain. We hope to advance\\nthis endeavour when the next meeting of participating\\nnations takes place in Cape Town in March 1996.\\nOn 13 September 1995 South Africa became the\\nthirty-seventh State party to the Convention on the\\nProhibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling\\nand Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.\\nOn the same day South Africa also acceded to the\\nConvention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of\\nCertain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed\\nto Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate\\nEffects. The ratification of the chemical weapons\\nConvention again underlines the commitment of the\\nGovernment of National Unity to the non-proliferation of\\nweapons of mass destruction. South Africa’s accession to\\nthe Convention on certain conventional weapons\\nunderlines my Government’s commitment to the\\nelimination of the suffering that is caused by the scourge\\nof war. South Africa has, for this reason, decided to\\nextend its moratorium on the export of land-mines by the\\nintroduction of a permanent ban on the export or sale of\\nlong-lived anti-personnel land-mines. Furthermore, on\\n30 August 1995 the Government of National Unity\\napproved the draft of a new conventional-arms-control\\npolicy. A National Conventional Arms Control Committee\\nhas been established and will function in accordance with\\npredetermined guiding principles and criteria to ensure\\nthat arms trade and transfers conform to accepted\\ninternational practice.\\nAs previously mentioned, the principal role of the\\nUnited Nations is to safeguard international peace and\\nsecurity in order to implement universal respect for\\nhuman rights and to create conditions necessary for\\nsustainable development. Without peace, security and\\nhuman rights, sustainable development will be difficult to\\nachieve. Without development and respect for human\\nrights, international peace and security will continually be\\nthreatened.\\n3\\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\\nAs President Mandela stated in 1992,\\n“Our common humanity transcends the oceans\\nand all national boundaries. It binds us together in\\ncommon cause against tyranny, to act together in\\ndefence of our very humanity. Let it never be asked of\\nany one of us what we did when we knew that\\nanother was oppressed.”\\nMankind should learn to act against all tyranny in a\\nunified manner through the United Nations. This should be\\nour basic aim for the future.\\nSouth Africa also wishes to call attention to the\\nactivities of mercenaries, irrespective of their origin and\\nobjectives. Their destabilizing activities cannot be tolerated.\\nWe call on the international community and the United\\nNations to be seized of this problem of mercenaries.\\nThe women of South Africa have lived, in varying\\ndegrees, under three forms of oppression, relating to race,\\nto class and to gender. One of the first steps towards\\ninitiating positive change in the lives of all South African\\nwomen was the entrenchment of gender rights in our Bill\\nof Rights. It was with much pride that the South African\\ndelegation took their seats at the Fourth World Conference\\non Women, in Beijing. That was the first time South Africa\\nparticipated in a conference on women which focused on\\nthe eradication of poverty, and equal access to education\\nand to health services. South Africa is fully committed to\\nimplementing the Platform for Action adopted at that\\nConference, which will serve as the impetus for a world of\\nequality, development and peace for all. In addition, our\\nParliament has most recently approved South Africa’s\\nratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All\\nForms of Discrimination against Women, without any\\nreservations.\\nYears of apartheid rule have bequeathed the\\noverwhelming majority black population with a heavy\\nlegacy of poverty, social disintegration and political\\ncleavages based on colour and ethnic animosities. It\\ntherefore became the priority task of the South African\\nGovernment of National Unity to devise a national strategy\\nto address this catastrophic situation. A comprehensive and\\nmulti-pronged developmental strategy known as the\\nReconstruction and Development Programme is now being\\nimplemented. The implementation of this Programme relies\\nprimarily on the mobilization of domestic resources through\\nprioritization of budgetary resources, with a view to\\naddressing the huge material inequalities in such areas as\\neducation, health, housing, infrastructure development and\\nland reform. It is a unique people-centred and people-\\ndriven Programme, which seeks to translate into economic\\nbenefit the political miracle in our country. At the very\\nheart of this Programme is the acknowledgement of the\\ninextricable interdependence between the need for\\ntransparent, accountable and democratic governance of\\nour society and the imperative of dynamic economic\\ngrowth and sustainable development.\\nSouth Africa will host the ninth United Nations\\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD IX)\\nfrom 26 April to 11 May 1996. This is an event which all\\nSouth Africans are looking forward to with great\\nexpectation. Indeed, it is my pleasure to announce that\\nour preparations are well advanced and on course.\\nWe attach great significance to UNCTAD IX for a\\nnumber of reasons. We believe that the rapid progress of\\nglobalization and liberalization of the world economy has\\nunderscored the relevance and importance of UNCTAD\\nas a United Nations institution with a strong development\\nmandate and perspective. We also believe that the\\nsuccessful completion of the Uruguay Round of\\nnegotiations and the resultant creation of the World Trade\\nOrganization not only has stressed the validity and\\nrelevance of UNCTAD, but has also reinforced the need\\nto retain and strengthen UNCTAD’s mandate as a policy-\\noriented global intergovernmental forum on trade and\\ndevelopment issues. It is a forum where a strong\\npartnership for development between the developed and\\nthe developing countries can, and must, be forged. While\\nthere may be a need to streamline certain UNCTAD\\nactivities, this should not lead to its demise. Without\\nUNCTAD, our world, especially the developing world,\\nwould be the poorer.\\nI would like to take this opportunity to express my\\nGovernment’s satisfaction with the intergovernmental\\nprocess at the United Nations to draw up a United\\nNations Agenda for Development. We believe that the\\nUnited Nations is the appropriate forum for the\\nelaboration of the Agenda for Development. The Agenda\\nfor Development could open great possibilities for\\ndevelopment and for partnership between the developed\\nand the developing countries. It is for this reason that\\nSouth Africa is taking great interest in the work of the Ad\\nHoc Open-ended Working Group of the General\\nAssembly on an Agenda for Development.\\nMy Government has been following with great\\ninterest the ongoing High-level Intergovernmental\\nMeeting on the Mid-term Global Review of the\\n4\\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\\nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the Least\\nDeveloped Countries. In this connection, I join others in\\ncalling on the international community to devise a global\\nstrategy to effectively address the debt question confronting\\nthe least developed countries, and to use innovative\\nmeasures — whether it be official development aid, foreign\\ndirect investment or multilateral financial assistance — to\\narrest the decline of resources destined for the least\\ndeveloped countries.\\nI would also like to call upon the international\\ncommunity to vigorously pursue measures required to\\nsuccessfully implement the United Nations New Agenda for\\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s. We are pleased in\\nthat regard by the progress registered during the Economic\\nand Social Council’s session in Geneva, especially the high-\\nlevel segment, which was devoted to the aforementioned\\nAgenda. Of course, the challenge before the international\\ncommunity is to find adequate resources to translate this\\nAgenda into tangible results. It is our hope that this issue\\nwill be treated with the required urgency, given that next\\nyear there will be a mid-term global review of the New\\nAgenda for the Development of Africa.\\nRecognizing the importance of cooperation between\\ndeveloping States, South Africa has acceded to an\\nagreement establishing the South Centre. The South Centre\\nwill effectively operate as a policy research unit for the\\nNon-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77, and will draft\\npolicy-oriented position papers on issues of critical\\nimportance to the South. It will, in addition to this basic\\nfunction, generate ideas and proposals for consideration by\\nGovernments of the South and other institutions.\\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and\\nDevelopment engendered a process of environmental action\\nand awareness centred on the relationship between\\neconomic development and the sustainable management of\\nthe environment. It is our duty to carry this process forward\\nin an integrated manner and reconfirm our commitment to\\nthe implementation of international agreements which seek\\nto manage and preserve the world’s environment.\\nSouth Africa is very conscious that the capacity of\\ndeveloping countries to implement sustainable\\nenvironmental strategies will have to be strengthened. The\\nresources pledged towards the attainment of goals set out in\\nAgenda 21 will have to be made available if we are to\\nsucceed in achieving the imperatives of development,\\nsustainable use of the environment, and democracy in the\\nworld.\\nIn Africa, in particular, the ravages of drought and\\nthe advances of desertification require urgent attention.\\nThe global community’s concern for the environment\\nshould be reflected in a common approach to the\\nmanifold environmental pressures threatening our global\\nheritage.\\nThe United Nations also has an important role to\\nplay in assisting States threatened by natural or man-made\\ndisasters. Preventive diplomacy can contribute towards\\neliminating man-made disasters. However, the results of\\nboth man-made disasters and natural disasters can be\\nameliorated by effective international humanitarian\\nassistance coordination through the United Nations. This\\nwill naturally require more coherent programmed delivery\\nand coordination by the Office of the United Nations\\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Food\\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\\n(FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the\\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United\\nNations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) and\\nother international institutions. The United Nations will\\nhave to ensure that the necessary capacities and\\nmechanisms are created. Recent international action,\\nespecially the follow-up to the Tokyo Conference, has\\ndemonstrated that sufficient international will exists to\\nperform this function.\\nWe welcome the adoption on 14 September 1995 of\\nGeneral Assembly resolution 49/252, on the strengthening\\nof the United Nations. I wish to assure the Assembly of\\nour intention to work constructively with the President in\\nthis endeavour.\\nThe world in which we find ourselves today is\\ngreatly changed from just 10 years ago. The cold war has\\nended, the scourge of apartheid has been removed from\\nour common society and peace has come to Mozambique\\nand now Angola. We have also seen the membership of\\nour United Nations increase to 185, a substantial increase\\nsince the time the Security Council’s membership was last\\nincreased. As a result of these, and other, factors the\\ninternational community faces a window of opportunity\\nwithin which the Security Council can be successfully\\nrestructured and reformed.\\nWithin the overall effort to reform the United\\nNations, South Africa believes that the structure and\\nfunctioning of the Security Council should be reformed to\\nmake it more representative, democratic and transparent.\\nThe product of these efforts must be a Security Council\\nthat is effective and legitimate, and that reflects the\\n5\\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\\nrealities of our modern world. This result can be achieved\\nonly if reform and restructuring is dealt with as a package.\\nOne of the products of this reform process must result in\\nAfrica having equitable representation on any enlarged\\nSecurity Council.\\nIt would be appropriate for me to conclude by\\nreferring to the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\\nThe people of South Africa will celebrate this fiftieth\\nanniversary in concert with the rest of the world.

You represent a country with which Greece maintains ties of sincere friendship. Your extensive experience in international affairs and the abilities which have distinguished you as a successful diplomat give us the certainty that the work of this session will be brought to a successful conclusion. I should also like to avail myself of the opportunity to express to your predecessor, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhuty, our appreciation of the able manner and the effectiveness with which he guided the work of the forty-first session of the General Assembly.\\nI should like, further, to pay tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the dedication with which he devotes his services to the safeguarding of peace, in accordance with the decisions of the United Nations.\\nThe Foreign Minister of Denmark, Mr. Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, as President of the European Community, has already presented the positions of its 12 member States on the main issues confronting us today. These positions, with which we fully concur, reflect the international activities and responsibilities of the Community , as well as the common policies developed by its member States aimed at the promotion of stability and co-operation in international relations.\\nI shall therefore limit myself to certain major issues of particular interest to Greece. The promotion of disarmament and out efforts to consolidate security constitute fundamental objectives of my Government's policy. Within the framework of that policy, which we have pursued with consistency, we have promoted a number of initiatives at the national, regional and international level. The Prime Minister of Greece, together with the leaders of the other countries participating in the well-known initiative of the Six, are continuing their untiring efforts towards nuclear disarmament.\\nThe momentous developments of recent days are a source of great satisfaction and of hope for the future. The agreement reached in principle between the United States and the Soviet Union for the elimination of Intermediate-range nuclear weapons constitutes a big step towards the banning of all nuclear weapons. We congratulate the leaders of the two super-Powers, President Ronald Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. The success of these negotiations gives us grounds for hoping that the relations between East and West will continue to improve. At the same time, we express the hope that an agreement on the reduction of strategic weapons by 50 per cent will become a reality, as will the complete cessation o ť all nuclear tests. However, we are also concerned at the continuing rapid increase m conventional armaments. The existing imbalances constitute a serious threat to international peace. We are convinced that, given the necessary good will, it is possible to reach viable agreements regarding balanced reductions of such armaments and an effective system of verification.\\nI would be remiss if I did not repeat at this point, as I did last year, our apprehension regarding the continuing spread and use of chemical weapons, which constitute a flagrant violation of existing international rules and agreements, we are convinced that one of the aims of the international community should be a complete ban on the production and use of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles.\\nThe reduction of all types of armaments is an imperative necessity in a world with limited natural and financial resources. While hundreds of millions of people on our planet are suffering from extreme poverty and are not in a position to develop their economies, the spending of vast amounts on armaments constitutes blatant provocation. That is why we attach particular importance to the result of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development. The adoption by consensus of its Final Document is an encouraging indication of the international community's political will to face the problems of developing countries through substantial progress in disarmament.\\nMy country, consistent with its policy of promoting peace and detente, has always supported the efforts of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe as a means of maintaining a constructive dialogue between East and West. We have every reason to hope that substantial progress will be achieved during the fourth phase of the Vienna meeting which has just begun. It is fortunate that this meeting comes at a time of encouraging activity in the field of conventional disarmament and of the agreement reached in principle between the two super-Powers on the elimination of the intermediate-range missiles from Europe. The circumstances in which the Vienna meeting is taking place are unique, and we should exploit them as a first-rate opportunity for the maintenance of security and the promotion of co-operation in Europe.\\nI should like to stress at this point that a condition for the maintenance of security and the promotion of co-operation in Europe and the improvement of the political climate in that region is the creation of a feeling of confidence. Specifically, the promotion of confidence at the regional level is an imperative need. My Government is proud that after continuous efforts it was able to develop the closest possible relations with most of Greece's neighbours. The Balkans, in the past the powder-keg of Europe, are today a model of regional co-operation between countries with different political and economic systems. I wish also to underline the consistency and firmness with which my Government supports the proposal to make the Balkans a zone free from nuclear and chemical weapons.\\nAnother area on which the attention of my Government is particularly focused is that of the Mediterranean, as it is related directly to the security of Greece. We have repeatedly stated that the Mediterranean should become a sea of peace, friendship and co-operation among its peoples. We have sincerely supported all efforts to that end.\\nWe deal with international problems and examine them simply from the viewpoint of the countries involved while tending to ignore the fact that, in the final analysis, it is the individual who is the victim of international conflicts. When some countries spend enormous amounts on armaments, instead of directing them to development projects necessary to improve the living standards of their people, in the end it is the individual who suffers. If countries that have blatantly violated and disregarded decisions of the United Nations persist in policies which have been condemned, again it is the individual who suffers.\\nMy Government is deeply concerned over the question of the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as the promotion of social, economic and cultural rights. The problem transcends regional relationships. It is a problem with international repercussions. We are particularly satisfied to see that the United Nations is continuing its efforts in this field and that it has not been discouraged by the many obstacles it has encountered and by the flagrant violations of human rights.\\nIt is our conviction that all States are bound to comply strictly with their international obligations deriving from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the relevant international instruments subsequently adopted. Compliance with these obligations is a duty, not an option. As far as we are concerned, we have always unequivocally condemned every violation of human rights, regardless of where and by whom it is committed. The Greek Government has taken an unreserved position in favour of the equality of the two sexes. It has actively participated in all regional and international efforts to ensure the complete elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. At the national level we have adopted policies in favour of a status of women equal to that of men, in all fields of economic, social and cultural life. Within the United Nations we actively support the strengthening of and an increase in the activities of the committees dealing with women's issues.\\nThe problem of international terrorism, although it has been less acute in recent months, is still a destabilizing factor in international relations. My country has severely suffered because of terrorism. My Government has repeatedly condemned and continues to condemn every terrorist act  regardless of its origin. The present session of the General Assembly will deal with this subject. We hope that it will be possible, with the co-operation of all States, to reach positive and substantive results and that the consensus reached during the fortieth session will be maintained.\\nYear after year the United Nations deals with a number of major international issues. These issues still appear on the agenda, which shows how little progress we have made towards their solution. However, there have been some encouraging developments.\\nWe welcome the recent initiative of the Heads of State of the five Central American countries which led to an agreement for the implementation of a peace plan in the area. We consider this to be a notable achievement by five small countries which have decided to take their fate into their own hands and establish the forms of co-operation for their own region. My Government is convinced that the countries in Central America cam peacefully resolve their problems without foreign intervention. We attach particular importance to the application of democratic procedures and to respect for human and civil rights, and we believe that proposals made for a unilateral cessation of hostilities can be of assistance in this respect. I believe that all countries should respond positively to the appeal made from this rostrum to ensure the success of the peace plan in Central America.\\nMy country, as is well known, attaches particular importance to developments in the Middle East, an area where not only peace in the region but also international stability and security are in danger. The Arab-Israeli conflict remains unresolved, as there has been no change in the situation created by the use of force, the occupation of Arab territories since 1967 by Israel and the lack of a substantive and comprehensive peace process. The fact that the idea of an international conference, which my country has supported for a long time, seems to be gaining ground, even among those that until recently categorically rejected it, gives us ground for hope. Greece has from the outset supported the idea of convening an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations for the solution of the Middle East problem in which all the directly interested parties would participate. Recent decisions of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the European Community present a satisfactory framework for starting an effective peace process.\\nWe believe, furthermore, that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) should participate in the conference and that the modalities of its participation concern the Arab countries and, in particular, the Palestinians themselves. This conference should have a substantive role, not be converted into a ceremonial forum. It is obvious that the modalities of the conference should be decided by the interested parties themselves, including the PLO, which is the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. We hope that the last obstacles impeding the convening of a conference may soon be overcome.\\nWe have repeatedly stressed that the basic pre-condition of a peace settlement in the Middle East is the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied Arab territories. We support the aspirations of the Palestinian people to exercise the fundamental, Inalienable right to self-determination, including the eight to create their own State.\\nAt the same time, it is well known that we support the right of Israel to exist as a State within internationally recognized and secure borders. However, Israel should not deny to the Palestinian people what it rightly seeks for itself - namely, the right to exist. Nor can the international community tolerate the illegal policy of the imposition of arbitrary measures, the establishment of settlements and the creation of fait accompli in the occupied territories. Such a policy, as in the case of Cyprus, is aimed at altering the legal status of the territories in question and their geographic, natural and demographic conditions, and distorting their history and the identity of their inhabitants.\\nThe tragic situation in Lebanon continues unabated despite some occasional faint hopes of a peace settlement, which unfortunately quickly fade. My country again calls upon the interested parties and those exercising influence to work peacefully to preserve the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Lebanon and eliminate violence.\\nThe war between Iran and Iraq also continues unabated despite the appeals and efforts of the international community. We have also recently witnessed an increase in tension in the vital area of the Gulf.\\nThe tragedy of that war, which entails enormous costs to the two peoples involved, and the magnitude of the dangers created by the ever increasing escalation of tension in the Gulf make it imperative that hostilities cease and peace talks begin, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, including resolution 598 (1987). We appreciate the devotion and courage which the Secretary-General displayed in discharging his duties during his mission, for the purpose of securing respect for and full implementation of those resolutions.\\nI also wish to stress the importance that my Government attaches to safeguarding free and secure navigation in the area. I must insist upon this point because, unfortunately, my country has suffered from indiscriminate attacks upon Greek merchant vessels, which have caused enormous material damage and the loss of innocent lives.\\nThe situation in southern Africa continues, regrettably, to endanger peace, security and stability. Greece is watching developments in the area with particular interest. The number of victims of apartheid Increases daily. The extension of the state of emergency and the continuous violations of human rights - in particular, detention of religious and trade union leaders, detention of children, torture and forced resettlement of the black population and strict press censorship - are developments that deeply preoccupy my Government.\\nThe Greek Government has repeatedly and unequivocally condemned the abhorrent system of apartheid and its inherent violence. We call upon the Government of South Africa to engage in a national dialogue with the genuine representatives of the majority of the population, which should lead to the complete eradication of apartheid and the establishment by peaceful means of a democratic, non-racial and United South Africa.\\nWe strongly condemn South Africa's repeated aggressive and destabilizing activities against the sovereignty, Independence and territorial integrity of neighbouring States. Greece affirms its solidarity with the front-line States, which should receive full International support in order to cope successfully with the threat against them. In 1986 a highly significant meeting took place in Lusaka between representatives of the European Community and the front-line States. I attended that meeting and remain convinced of its usefulness. I hope that those efforts will continue.\\nWe also strongly condemn the continuation of the illegal occupation by South Africa of Namibia, whose people are being denied the right to exercise the fundamental right to self-determination and independence. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) constitutes the sole internationally accepted basis for the peaceful solution of the problem. The Greek Government categorically rejects any linkage of the Implementation of resolution 435 (1978) with extraneous issues, as well as delaying tactics used for this purpose. We consider the establishment In Namibia of the so-called interim administration to be null and void.\\nThe Greek Government expresses its concern with regard to the dangerous situation prevailing in two areas of Asia: Afghanistan and Kampuchea. It is regrettable that diplomatic efforts towards their solution have not yet produced the hoped-for results. We are consistent in condemning all cases of invasion and occupation as well as every effort to create fait accompli. We therefore believe that unless all foreign troops in Afghanistan and Kampuchea are withdrawn as soon as possible in accordance with United Nations resolutions no viable solution can be reached. It is imperative that the bloodshed and suffering of the people of these two countries be brought to an end.\\nWith regard to the situation in the Korean peninsula, we hope that a just and peaceful solution will be found, to the benefit of the entire Korean people, in accordance with the generally accepted principles of international law. We believe that the promotion of confidence-building measures in the Korean peninsula will create the appropriate conditions for the Olympic Games of 1988 to take place in an atmosphere of co-operation rather than confrontation.\\nThe international economic situation shows signs of stress. Imbalances remain, growth rates are low and the future is uncertain. The resumption of high and stable growth rates must be secured in order to bring about solutions to the debt problems of the developing countries and an improvement in the market conditions for their primary commodities.\\nThe third world's external debt crisis must be resolved through dialogue and greater understanding of the problem by the international community. We should not lose sight of the political dimension of this problem. The people of the over—indebted countries shouldering the unbearable burden of external debt are deprived of a dignified standard of living. As a result, phenomena of social turmoil have surfaced. The low prices of primary commodities have severely curtailed the exchange earnings of a large number of developing countries. Those countries face serious difficulties in servicing their external debt while implementing strict stabilization programmes, unfortunately, development assistance to those countries and flows of new capital from the international financial system have not yet reached the levels necessary to permit successful implementation of their stabilization policies. For that reason development efforts have fallen behind.\\nThe final text adopted by the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) provides a framework for remedial solutions. At the same time imaginative and courageous solutions should be pursued In international forums, particularly at the International Monetary Fund, whose annual meetings begin today.\\nI should like to elaborate on an issue of particular concern to the Greek nation that in recent years has been repeatedly dealt with by the United Nations. I am referring to the problem of Cyprus, prolongation of which entails a serious threat to peace and security, not only in the immediate vicinity but also in the broader area of the eastern Mediterranean.\\nMore than 13 years have passed since the Turkish array, in flagrant violation of the basic principles of international law, invaded Cyprus and occupied a large part of the territory of the Republic. After the invasion Ankara attempted as a first step to stabilize its military occupation and to drive out those remaining Greek Cypriots who had not yet fled, to become refugees in their own country, the Invading Turkish army. Subsequently, Ankara attempted to alter the demographic composition of the population through a massive influx of settlers, which it organized politically in order to support an illegal government whose existence depends on the equally illegal presence of the army of occupation. Furthermore, by destroying the cultural heritage of northern Cyprus, by plundering churches and by changing place-names, it is attempting to impose partition and create two separate states in an effort to avert the unity of Cyprus.\\nFor 13 years Turkey has systematically avoided any discussion of those subjects which, by definition, are pre-eminent; namely, withdrawal of the occupation array; agreement on a system of guarantees that would preclude the presentation of pretexts such as those Ankara has raised to justify its invasion; and withdrawal of the settlers and application of elementary human rights concerning freedom of movement, freedom of settlement and the right to property.\\nAnkara has refused to discuss those questions, which obviously should occupy a central position in the consultations. On the contrary, through repeated statements made by Turkey or the Turkish Cypriot leadership, Ankara has made it clear that it has no intention of withdrawing its military forces from the territory of Cyprus, which it is systematically reinforcing with new modern tanks as well as through increasing military personnel. The recent report of the United Nations Secretary-General to the Security Council gives an extremely clear picture of the situation in the area and points out a number of other Turkish and Turkish Cypriot activities that aim solely at the consolidation of the illegal occupation.\\nThe Government of the Republic of Cyprus, in an attempt to help the Secretary-General in his mission of good offices, has proposed alternative procedures aiming at the examination of the aforementioned major issues, that is, either at a high-level meeting or at an international conference. The Greek Government fully supports the position of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus that, before any further discussion on other issues that have already been dealt with, the major issues should be examined - namely, withdrawal of the occupation forces and of the settlers, a new system of enlarged international guarantees precluding the possibility of unilateral intervention and the three freedoms.\\nIt should in particular be stressed that up to now Turkey has refused any discussion of those issues. That attitude is a clear indication of its ultimate aims. It wants to entrap the Government of the Republic of Cyprus into accepting a constitutional system that would serve Turkish interests solely and make no provision for the withdrawal of the occupation army or the settlers or for the restoration of the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus. However, the position of Ankara is highly provocative when it argues that a discussion of the critical problem of Cyprus at this session constitutes a manifestation of intransigence. Indeed, I am astonished at that argument, which expresses a deeper contempt for the United Nations and for the inalienable right of every sovereign Member State to have recourse to the Organization in every case of violation of the principles of the Charter and of the resolutions of United Nations organs.\\nConfronted with this situation we have to decide where our duty lies. It would be distressing and dangerous were we to limit ourselves to the expression of hopes and to regrets over lack of progress. I believe it is time for all of us to face up to our responsibilities and to make it crystal clear that force cannot be accepted as a way of resolving international problems,\\nGreece is convinced that a just and viable solution to the Cyprus question should be sought within the framework of the United Nations and, more specifically/ through the implementation of the numerous General Assembly and Security Council resolutions, which clearly and unequivocally provide for ways to resolve all these major Issues, it is only natural that we look to the United Nations for a just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem. An injustice committed in any part of the world is an injustice against mankind. It is therefore the duty of mankind to restore justice.\\n</td>\n","      <td>24242</td>\n","      <td>[allow, sir, behalf, government, greece, congratulate, election, president, forty-second, session, general, assembly, represent, country, greece, maintains, ties, sincere, friendship, extensive, experience, international, affairs, abilities, distinguished, successful, diplomat, give, us, certainty, work, session, brought, successful, conclusion, like, avail, opportunity, express, predecessor, foreign, minister, bangladesh, mr, humayun, rasheed, choudhuty, appreciation, able, manner, effectiveness, guided, work, forty-first, session, general, assembly, like, pay, tribute, secretary-general, united, nations, mr, javier, perez, de, cuellar, dedication, devotes, services, safeguarding, peace, accordance, decisions, united, nations, foreign, minister, denmark, mr, uffe, ellemann-jensen, president, european, community, already, presented, positions, member, states, main, issues, confronting, us, today, positions, fully, concur, reflect, ...]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4546</th>\n","      <td>55</td>\n","      <td>2000</td>\n","      <td>KHM</td>\n","      <td>Cambodia</td>\n","      <td>Hor Namhong</td>\n","      <td>Minister for Foreign Affairs</td>\n","      <td>On behalf of the\\ndelegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia, I am\\nparticularly pleased to extend, through you, Mr. Acting\\nPresident, my warmest congratulations on the occasion\\nof the election of Mr. Harri Holkeri as President of the\\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly of the\\nUnited Nations.

The Kingdom of Cambodia, with its\\nprofound belief that the value of democracy and human\\nrights should be in harmony with cultural peculiarities,\\ntraditions, and level of development, considers human\\nrights to be one of the foundations of the system of\\ngovernment. The Royal Government of Cambodia, at\\npresent, is making great efforts towards the\\nreinforcement of democratic pluralism and the rule of\\nlaw.\\nThe recently held Millennium Summit on the role\\nof the United Nations in the twenty-first century has,\\nthrough its Millennium Declaration, defined great\\nguidelines on this universal institution's policies and\\nreforms, designed to overcome problems facing our\\nplanet in the third millennium. The shared reflection of\\nour leaders is testimony to the aspirations of all peoples\\nthroughout the world for a more equitable international\\nenvironment in the face of rapid globalization and its\\neffects on the economic, social and cultural\\ndevelopment of all nations.\\nOn the question of the Security Council, the\\nRoyal Government of Cambodia believes, as do many\\nMember States, that it is very important for the\\nSecurity Council to reflect the reality of today's world.\\nThis can be achieved by expanding the permanent and\\nnon-permanent membership of the Council to the\\ndeveloping countries and to those countries that have\\nconcretely contributed to sharing the burden of United\\nNations operations. Only through overall reform and\\nenlargement will the Security Council be able to\\nmaintain its effectiveness and legitimacy in this new\\nmillennium. In this regard, Cambodia strongly supports\\nJapan's and India's permanent membership in this core\\nbody of the United Nations.\\nThe Kingdom of Cambodia observes with great\\ninterest the situation in the Middle East. We urge both\\nsides to make greater efforts in order to achieve lasting\\npeace in this suffering region. The Kingdom of\\nCambodia reaffirms its total support for a fair,\\nequitable, durable, and global settlement based on the\\nrelevant resolutions of the United Nations and on the\\napplication of the agreed-upon peace accords, so that\\nthe inalienable rights of the Palestinian people will be\\nrecognized by all.\\nIn spite of the consequences of the financial crisis\\nin 1997 and 1998, Asia is on the road to recovery and\\nAsia's economic growth has ever since been recorded.\\nThe thirty-third Association of Southeast Asian\\nNations (ASEAN) Ministerial Meeting held this past\\nJuly in Bangkok bears witness once more to the\\nexemplary solidarity between member States to\\nintegrate their economies and to further advance their\\nmultiform cooperation.\\nThe Kingdom of Cambodia is very pleased with\\nthe inter-Korean summit meeting in Pyongyang last\\nJune, which we consider as an important landmark in\\nthe relationship between the two brotherly nations, and\\nwhich has enormously contributed to the maintenance\\nof peace and stability in its region as well as in the\\nwhole world and to the peaceful reunification of Korea.\\n(spoke in French)\\n25\\n\\nWe are witnessing, today, the growing\\nphenomenon of globalization. There are no States that\\ncan avoid its immense impact on our daily life.\\nHowever, the process of globalization is not a\\nsufficient answer to the quest of the developing\\ncountries to reach progress and development for better\\nliving conditions of their people. It is clear that the\\nimpact of globalization benefits, primarily, States\\nhaving strong economies and advanced technology,\\nwhile leaving the least developed countries with little,\\nif any, means to cope with such reality.\\nThe developing countries, especially the least\\ndeveloped countries, that cannot catch up with\\nglobalization's speed will be left behind. The rich\\ncountries will get richer and more developed, and the\\npoor countries will get poorer and poorer.\\nTherefore, the Royal Government of Cambodia\\ncalls all Member States of the United Nations to unite\\ntheir efforts and resources to make sure that the\\nbenefits of globalization are expanded more equally\\namong the international community and to maximize\\nthe positive impact of this phenomenon in order to\\nenable the least developed countries to follow the trend\\nof globalization.\\nAnother aspect of finance for development is the\\ncrushing burden of debt that weighs on the developing\\ncountries. Debt places a heavy burden on the\\ndevelopment process of many developing countries.\\nUnfortunately, the debt strategies that have been\\nimplemented so far have not proved capable of solving\\nthis problem.\\nThe Royal Government of Cambodia appreciates\\nthe initiative taken by some nations in agreeing to\\nsolve the intolerable debt burden of the least developed\\ncountries. However, the results are currently far from\\nbeing sufficient. That is why we appeal for these\\ninitiatives to be adopted by some other members of the\\ninternational community, enabling more poor countries\\nto benefit from these human and just actions.\\nCambodia sincerely hopes that the Millennium\\nSummit, which has just successfully concluded, will\\nbring about the imperative reform of the United\\nNations. The reform of this important world body will\\npositively respond to the reality of the world today, and\\nwould be able, I hope, to establish a new mechanism to\\nsave the developing countries from becoming victims\\nof globalization, even as other countries derive greater\\nand greater benefit.\\nIn this context, as the United Nations has been\\ncalled upon by the Millennium Summit to play a more\\ndecisive role in ensuring that the development of\\nnations is more equitable, it is necessary that this world\\ninstitution possess the means to support its actions.\\nAlso, it is an imperative requirement to establish a new\\nmechanism of relations between the United Nations\\nand the international financial institution.\\n Moreover, it is necessary to have a new order of\\ninternational relations in view of the rapid phenomenon\\nof globalization, so as to reduce the ever-increasing\\nunjust gap between the rich and poor countries. I am\\nconvinced that this is not a matter of generosity, but a\\nmatter of human security, as well as the security of the\\nentire international community.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n","

behalf of the Government and people of Papua New Guinea, I congratulate Mr. Garba of Nigeria on his unanimous election to the important post of President of the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are confident that under his able leadership the challenging work before the Assembly will be carried to its conclusion with efficiency and success. I should also like to register Papua New Guinea's sincere appreciation of the excellent job accomplished by his predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina.\\nIn addition, let me add my Government's voice to the voices of those who have already spoken in praise of the commendable work being done by the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, and his staff in implementing United Nations programmes. Papua New Guinea continues to regard the United Nations as having a unique role in working for the relaxation of tensions, the resolution of conflicts and the building of a strong framework for international co-operation based on mutual respect and understanding. Papua New Guinea remains committed to playing its part in contributing to achieving this objective.\\nMy delegation attends this session with the hope that we shall collectively take advantage of the opportunities before us to hasten the realization of the global environment that the founders of the United Nations envisaged for us and future generations.\\nWe have before us this year another complex agenda which, among other things, points to an international community saddled with a great number of problems. Some of these problems date back to before the United Nations was even established. Yet it is the responsibility of the Assembly to work for the resolution of those problems. The uncertainty that they cause is felt by all of us, and for many developing countries, including Papua New Guinea, has a direct impact on our development efforts. But there is still some hope and optimism. Papua New Guinea believes with a good measure of confidence that positive steps have been taken in dealing with the problems which are the subject of this session's attention.\\nMy delegation highly commends the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his tireless efforts in upholding the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. We note with considerable satisfaction his comprehensive report, which records process being made in resolving regional tensions and conflicts, among them those in Cambodia, Afghanistan, Namibia, apartheid South Africa, Western Sahara and Central America, and the Iran-Iraq conflict. The report also underscores the efforts being made to tackle other pressing issues, including the environment, disarmament, trade, finance, debt servicing and human rights.\\nOur own region, the South Pacific, is relatively free of major conflicts, but is nevertheless an area which is being given increasing attention by other countries and international organizations. The South Pacific is not immune from the effects of international tensions elsewhere and the worrying trends in the world economy.\\nThe community of the South Pacific comprises mainly small island States scattered in the vast Pacific Ocean. Our struggle is one of survival, a struggle to develop our people and national economies with the limited financial and technical resources available to us while at the same time keeping our region free of big-Power rivalry and the environment free of nuclear and other activities which could harm, if not destroy, our region's resources, including the most important source of livelihood for most island communities - fish and marine resources.\\nSince our independence in 1975 we have actively pursued the cause of decolonisation in the South Pacific. Most of our region has been decolonised, but there are some island communities whose future is still uncertain.\\nPapua New Guinea welcomes the progress being made by the Government of France in bringing political and administrative reforms to New Caledonia through the Matiqnon and other agreements signed between the French Government and the different political groups in the Territory. But we believe that the pace of change must be hastened and a clear commitment made for bringing the Territory to independence as soon as possible. Papua New Guinea regrets the tragic loss of Mr. Jean-Marie Tjibaou, President of the FLNKS, and his deputy, Mr. Yeiwene, on 4 May 1989. The deaths of the late President Tjibaou, Mr. Yeiwene and others who have championed the cause of independence in the Territory for so long and over the years made extensive representations within and outside the United Nations on behalf of their Territory, and who were among those who signed the Matignon agreements, show that more needs to be done by the Government of France to bring about changes 'which conform with the aspirations of the people of New Caledonia, especially the indigenous Kanaks.\\nBoth these leaders were men of great vision, strength and wisdom They made great sacrifices for the indigenous Melanesian people of New Caledonia. We pay tribute to then, and we know that their just struggle will not end.\\nNew Caledonia is on the United Nations list of Non-Self Governing Territories, following a decision of the Assembly in December 1986. The Assembly therefore has a continuing responsibility to monitor developments in the Territory closely. The Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, this year 'Strongly urged that the question of New Caledonia be kept under active consideration at the United Nations until the conditions for an internationally acceptable act of self-determination, in accordance with the principles and practices of the United Nations, have been met'. We also hope that the Administering Authority, in France, will comply fully with all its obligations as provided for in the United Nations Charter, and with General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV).\\nPapua New Guinea has also welcomed recent progress made under the Compact arrangements between the United States and the Micronesian islands. We have moved forward in establishing diplomatic relations with the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Marshall Islands. But we also look forward to the resolution of the outstanding issues affecting Palau's political future.\\nIn the South Pacific, Papua New Guinea is equally concerned about protection of the environment. On 10 August this year, Papua New Guinea ratified two important treaties which seek to protect our environment - namely, the South\\nPacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty and the Convention for the Protection of the Environment and Resources of the South Pacific. Taken as a package together with fisheries and other economic arrangements that are being progressively put in place, they represent important corner-stones for the protection of the environment in the South Pacific region, and for the management and development of its vast marine resources in accordance with the interests of the island communities. My Government intends to work closely with our partners in the South Pacific to fully implement these treaty arrangements, and, like those partners, we shall strongly - and especially oppose, France's continued nuclear-testing programme at Mururoa Atoll and all the other activities that are harmful to the resources and livelihood of our people.\\nSuch regional initiatives deserve the full and active support of the United Nations. They form part of the wider international concern about, and the action now being taken to protect, the global environment.\\nThe Government of Papua New Guinea applauds the decision of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China to ratify two of the three Protocols to the South Pacific nuclear-free-zone Treaty. We strongly urge other nuclear-weapons States, including France, the United Kingdom and the United States, to ratify the Protocols and respect the operations of this Treaty and other environmental arrangements in the South Pacific.\\nIn regional fisheries, a successful regional fisheries agreement between the United States and the countries members of the South Pacific Forum,, signed in 1987, is already contributing to the development of our fisheries resources. We are prepared to enter into similar arrangements with other major fishing nations, on the basis of fair and equitable returns for island States and principles designed to protect and carefully manage the fisheries resources and our environment. We urge the Government of Jap* to co-operate in unlocking the stalled negotiations on a regional fisheries arrangement with island States.\\nConsistent with the declaration made in July this year by the leaders of the South Pacific Forum, we also call on Japan and other distant-water-fishing nations to cease completely the harmful method of qill-net fishing often referred to as the 'wall of death' in the South Pacific. We are convinced that such a destructive and indiscriminate fishing practice will, if not halted, increasingly diminish our peoples* opportunities and chances not only of a livelihood but of survival in the future.\\nFisheries, trade development, transport and communications are among the major economic activities being pursued by island States and regional organizations established within the region, in our efforts to improve the welfare of our people and strengthen our wider connections with the international community. Papua New Guinea strongly supports the work of regional organizations in the South Pacific as well as other international agencies, including United Nations agencies, which collaborate closely with them in bringing development to our region.\\nPapua New Guinea's interest extends beyond the South Pacific region. Our foreign policy seeks to expand and diversify relationships with countries Members of the United Nations. Significant progress is already being made towards this commitment in the Asian region.\\nWe highly value our growing links with the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN is an impressive regional organization, which continues to promote understanding and co-operation in the South-East Asian region and elsewhere, through, among other things, the taking of constructive regional initiatives on issues such as Cambodia. Papua New Guinea has special observer statue at annual meetings off ASSAM foreign ministers. We are pleased that our relationship with ASEAN has been further strengthened this year through Papua Hew Guinea's accession on ? July 1989 to the Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation in South-East Asia.\\nAs I said earlier the agenda for this session is a complex one. A significant number of items quite rightly deal with initiatives to reduce international tensions and to promote the cause of peace and security. Papua New Guinea strongly supports international efforts to reduce tensions and the number of conflicts.\\nWe especially commend the leaderships in Moscow and in Washington. They have in recent years worked with a deep sense of commitment towards reducing international tensions, and we welcome their further commitment at this session to eliminate chemical weapons. We commend their efforts on disarmament. But we urge them to go even further. \\nTheir efforts in particular contributed to the climate of optimism that became evident at last year's session of the General Assembly, and have contributed to the maintenance of that climate this year. Their efforts and those of others, particularly members of the Security Council, must be supported if there is to be any further meaningful progress in the solution of problems in Cambodia, Afghanistan, the Middle East, the Korean peninsula, Namibia and southern Africa.\\nPapua New Guinea welcomes signals off Vietnamese troop withdrawals from Cambodia and hopes that the commitment this entails will be fulfilled, including free elections supervised by the United Nations, and that the people off Cambodia will reassert their identity and return to democracy, peace and tranquillity, and socio-economic progress.\\nThe situation in the Korean peninsula is also of concern to my Government. At independence, Papua New Guinea established formal diplomatic ties with both the Republic of Korea sad the Democratic Republic of Korea. Our links with the Republic of Korea have developed more rapidly. But our commitment is to support initiatives by both Koreas for the peaceful reunification of their people. Papua New Guinea urges the Governments of both Koreas to maintain active dialogue in working for understanding, reconciliation and efforts to achieve the peaceful unification of the Korean people. We note with great interest the proposals contained in fee address of President Roh Tae Wco on 11 September 1989 concerning national unification. The declaration, we believe, sets a constructive has is for discussions which could lead to early reunification. I reiterate again that fee Government of Papua New Guinea supports the admission of both North and South Korea as full Members of fee United Nations. Their admission, we believe, has fee potential to open up additional avenues towards dialogue, co-operation and understanding.\\nPapua New Guinea continues to believe that efforts Made to address the underlying causes of tension and conflict in the Middle East oust continue. My Government commends the parties - including the United Nations - involved in this important process. Papua New Guinea reaffirms its belief that the Palestinians have a right to a homeland just as much as Israel has a right to exist within secured borders. Those two conditions are fundamental to any lasting resolution of the tensions and conflicts in the Middle East. The problem of apartheid and the related colonial situation imposed by the racist regime of South Africa still exist in spite of numerous efforts by this body and other United Nations agencies. Papua New Guinea is of the firm belief that the option of mandatory sanctions against South Africa holds good prospects foe success both in dismantling apartheid and in achieving the independence of Namibia.\\nWith regard to global trade and the economic developments that have taken place in the recent past, we note that the industrialized countries have moved towards structural adjustment policies to address the issues of low growth and high inflation through the liberalization of trade, the elimination of industrial and agricultural subsidies and the creation of employment opportunities. We also note that many developing countries have experienced not only slow and stagnant economic growth but debt problems as well. As a result of these continuing economic difficulties many developing countries, including Papua New Guinea, have undertaken stringent economic policies and programmes to maintain sustainable economic growth.\\nWhile there has been progress in some of those areas, Papua New Guinea, with a developing and agriculturally based economy, is concerned that the effects of protectionist pressure exercised by industrialized economies on some of our\\nstrategic agricultural export commodities have adversely influenced our national plans and efforts to achieve sustainable economic growth. It is therefore imperative that the efforts of the global community, through the United Nations and its agencies as well as the current Uruguay Round of negotiations, should be strengthened to address such trade practices and distortions in order to ensure balanced, liberalised and fair trade between the countries in the international market.\\nIn conclusion, my delegation believes that the most important and pressing issue in the world today is the question of peace and development. Peace is the pre-condition for economic development through the expansion of international co-operation. Only in an international environment of peace and stability can the economic development of all nations be enhanced. Papua New Guinea therefore attaches great importance to international efforts aimed at achieving peace, harmony and development in the world. He also fully support efforts aimed at dealing with the growing problems of trade protectionism, debt servicing and the slowing down of financial transfers to developing countries.\\nPapua New Guinea has taken note of the overwhelming support delegations have given to the need for and effectiveness of the United Nations system. While there can be some criticisms about the Organisation's ability to deal with problems affecting the international community, ray delegation believes that there are positive signs that the United Nations network of agencies has been given a chance to work. A considerable amount of momentum has developed within the United Nations in tackling and seeking solutions to some of the world's problems. We must all take full advantage of these opportunities.\\n\\n

     \n","3738  Mr. President, I wish to\\nextend to you, on behalf of the South African delegation,\\nmy sincere congratulations on your election to the\\npresidency of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\\nYour election demonstrates the high regard in which the\\ninternational community holds your country. I should also\\nlike to express our deep gratitude to your predecessor, His\\nExcellency Mr. Amara Essy, a brother from Africa and the\\nForeign Minister of Côte d’Ivoire, who presided over the\\nforty-ninth session with great wisdom. I should also like to\\nexpress to the Secretary-General, His Excellency\\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our continued confidence in\\nhis guidance of the Organization.\\nA half century ago representatives from 50 countries\\nmet at San Francisco to draft the United Nations Charter,\\nthe Declaration of Human Rights and the Statute of the\\nInternational Court of Justice. For the United Nations to\\nhave survived for a period of 50 years in an imperfect\\nworld is indeed a milestone and a tribute to the visionary\\nsteps taken half a century ago towards the creation of a\\nbetter world.\\nSouth Africa’s involvement with the United Nations\\ngoes back to the very conception and birth of this\\nillustrious body. The then-Prime Minister of South Africa,\\nField Marshal J. C. Smuts, helped to draft the Preamble\\nto the Charter of the United Nations. In the Preamble\\nmany lofty ideas were expressed, among which were the\\nfollowing:\\n“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in\\nthe dignity and worth of the human person, in the\\nequal rights of men and women and of nations large\\nand small”.\\nHow ironic that those in power in South Africa since\\nthen, and until last year, acted in a precisely contrary\\nspirit. The United Nations contributed significantly in\\nbringing about change in South Africa. Through\\nperseverance and commitment, the United Nations\\nassisted us in our struggle to achieve democracy. Our\\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\\nreward is its reward. I should like again to express the\\ngratitude of both the people and the Government of South\\nAfrica for its foresight and courage.\\nJust over a year ago, on 23 June 1994 to be precise,\\nI had the honour to address the Assembly on behalf of the\\npeople and the Government of the Republic of South\\nAfrica. On that occasion, which marked South Africa’s\\nresumption of its participation in the work of the General\\nAssembly of the United Nations, we were filled with joy\\nand pride at the peaceful transition of South Africa into a\\nunited, non-racial, democratic and non-sexist society.\\nIn the intervening months I have travelled to many\\ncountries, visited with many foreign ministers and met with\\nseveral Heads of State or Government. We spoke of the\\nmiracle that is South Africa. We shared our thoughts and\\nexperiences on the road to that miracle. In that context, we\\ncontinue to encourage those who seek change for a better\\nlife to stand fast in their belief.\\nAs the representative of a Member of the United\\nNations, I should like to reassure you of our belief in and\\nsupport for the purposes and principles of the Charter of the\\nOrganization.\\nThe events in April 1994 in South Africa marked a\\nbreak with the past as well as a commitment to the future,\\nplacing a heavy burden on us. As a young democracy, we\\nare ready to meet the challenge. South Africa will meet this\\nchallenge with a firm commitment to the promotion of\\nnational welfare, prosperity and security, with a firm\\ncommitment to the strengthening of cooperation in the\\npursuit of the economic development and security of the\\nsouthern African subregion, with an active commitment to\\npeace, stability and good governance within the African\\nregion and elsewhere, with a firm commitment to South-\\nSouth cooperation and with a commitment to responsible\\ninternational citizenship.\\nThe Southern African Development Community\\n(SADC) was conceived in the struggle for freedom in\\nsouthern Africa and born of the courage of its leaders in\\nsetting out to create a new reality.\\nThe liberation of South Africa and the end of southern\\nAfrica’s destabilization brought great opportunities for the\\ndevelopment of our subregion. We must now translate those\\nhopes into reality. In accordance with the Abuja Treaty, we\\nmust transform the southern African region into one of the\\nreliable building blocks on which Africa’s economic\\nregeneration will be built.\\nOur greatest need today is to eradicate the scourge\\nof poverty afflicting the great mass of our people. Only\\nthen can we fulfil the dream of Africa’s liberation in the\\nhealth, happiness and well-being of its children.\\nThe mission of SADC reflects the reality that\\nsouthern Africa has long since passed the stage of\\nlamenting the privations of the past. The challenge is to\\nfind within ourselves the resources to overcome this\\nlegacy, with the cooperation of the international\\ncommunity. We need to adapt to the demands of a rapidly\\nchanging world economy and to develop the skills needed\\nto compete internationally.\\nSouth Africa’s main objective is to play a\\nconstructive role in bringing peace and stability to the\\nregion. We are totally committed to the utilization of\\npreventive diplomacy, peace-keeping and peacemaking,\\nthrough the use of regional and multilateral mechanisms.\\nIn this context, South Africa participated with others\\nin the resolution of the conflict in Lesotho and provided\\nlogistical support for the elections in Mozambique. Our\\nsupport for United Nations resolutions and actions\\nregarding Angola and the Western Sahara should also be\\nseen in that light.\\nAs an elected member of the Central Organ of the\\nConflict Resolution Mechanism of the Organization of\\nAfrican Unity (OAU) from June 1994 to June 1995, we\\nparticipated in several missions to Burundi. South Africa\\nwas part of a special four-member ministerial mission\\nelected to assess the nature and the scope of the Burundi\\nconflict with a view to encouraging and assisting the\\nBurundians to resolve their differences and end that\\nconflict. We continue to participate in the Mechanism as\\nan invited observer.\\nIn view of the desperate situation in the former\\nYugoslavia and in Rwanda, it has become imperative for\\nStates to cooperate as far as possible with the respective\\nad hoc criminal tribunals that have been created for those\\nterritories. In that regard, my country has made available\\nsome of its most talented jurists to assist.\\nThese situations have demonstrated anew the real\\nneed for the establishment of a permanent international\\ncriminal court. This issue has been revitalized in the past\\nfew years, and a window of opportunity now exists to\\nfinally bring the court into existence. It is my sincere\\nhope that significant progress will be made in that regard\\nduring this session of the General Assembly.\\n2\\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the United\\nNations, mankind is still faced with political instability,\\ndictatorship, corruption, civil war, millions of refugees and\\ninternally displaced persons, persistent economic decline\\nand continued impoverishment.\\nIn the past year, the international political climate has\\nexperienced a succession of changes which have brought\\nboth hope and a certain measure of despair to mankind.\\nHope has, however, remained a beckoning beacon bringing\\nabout a sense of confidence in the future. We were\\nsaddened by events in Somalia, but rejoiced at the transition\\nin Haiti and El Salvador. We despair at the tragedy that is\\nBosnia, yet hope that the emerging signs of a solution will\\ncome to fruition.\\nIn this spirit, allow me to congratulate the peoples of\\nIsrael and Palestine on having reached yet another landmark\\nin their journey towards a lasting settlement. We encourage\\nand support the Middle East peace process.\\nThe issues of proliferation and disarmament, in\\nparticular nuclear disarmament, are among the major\\nquestions that have been facing the international community\\nin recent times. At the historic 1995 Review and Extension\\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), all those present\\nagreed to exercise the utmost restraint pending the entry\\ninto force of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We are of the\\nview that the recent tests conducted by two nuclear-weapon\\nStates are retrogressive steps in the international\\ncommunity’s endeavour to ban nuclear testing. We believe\\nthat these tests will negatively affect the outcome of work\\non a comprehensive test-ban treaty. The South African\\nGovernment is strongly opposed to these and any further\\nnuclear tests being conducted, and calls upon those States\\nto cease testing, so as to enhance international efforts\\ntowards non-proliferation and disarmament. We call upon\\nthem to honour both the letter and the spirit of the\\nPrinciples and Objectives which they agreed to and helped\\nnegotiate at the NPT Review and Extension Conference.\\nSouth Africa has dismantled its nuclear capability. South\\nAfrica, for its part, has proven its commitment to nuclear\\ndisarmament. Now it is the turn of others to manifest a\\nsimilar commitment.\\nSouth Africa notes with great satisfaction the progress\\nachieved thus far towards the establishment of an African\\nnuclear-weapon-free zone. We have been actively involved\\nin trying to find solutions to the outstanding issues, and we\\ntrust that these hurdles can be overcome and the draft treaty\\nof Pelindaba can receive due consideration during this\\nsession of the General Assembly. The draft treaty is\\nimportant as it would expand the non-nuclear-weapon\\narea of the globe considerably and would be a further step\\ntowards the final goal of complete nuclear disarmament.\\nSouth Africa appeals to the nuclear-weapon States to\\nensure that the draft treaty is concluded and the relevant\\nprotocols signed.\\nSince the 1986 declaration of the Zone of Peace and\\nCooperation of the South Atlantic, significant progress has\\nbeen made in the political, economic, scientific, technical\\nand cultural spheres to further the objectives of the Zone.\\nOnly relatively few obstacles remain. We hope to advance\\nthis endeavour when the next meeting of participating\\nnations takes place in Cape Town in March 1996.\\nOn 13 September 1995 South Africa became the\\nthirty-seventh State party to the Convention on the\\nProhibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling\\nand Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.\\nOn the same day South Africa also acceded to the\\nConvention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of\\nCertain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed\\nto Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate\\nEffects. The ratification of the chemical weapons\\nConvention again underlines the commitment of the\\nGovernment of National Unity to the non-proliferation of\\nweapons of mass destruction. South Africa’s accession to\\nthe Convention on certain conventional weapons\\nunderlines my Government’s commitment to the\\nelimination of the suffering that is caused by the scourge\\nof war. South Africa has, for this reason, decided to\\nextend its moratorium on the export of land-mines by the\\nintroduction of a permanent ban on the export or sale of\\nlong-lived anti-personnel land-mines. Furthermore, on\\n30 August 1995 the Government of National Unity\\napproved the draft of a new conventional-arms-control\\npolicy. A National Conventional Arms Control Committee\\nhas been established and will function in accordance with\\npredetermined guiding principles and criteria to ensure\\nthat arms trade and transfers conform to accepted\\ninternational practice.\\nAs previously mentioned, the principal role of the\\nUnited Nations is to safeguard international peace and\\nsecurity in order to implement universal respect for\\nhuman rights and to create conditions necessary for\\nsustainable development. Without peace, security and\\nhuman rights, sustainable development will be difficult to\\nachieve. Without development and respect for human\\nrights, international peace and security will continually be\\nthreatened.\\n3\\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\\nAs President Mandela stated in 1992,\\n“Our common humanity transcends the oceans\\nand all national boundaries. It binds us together in\\ncommon cause against tyranny, to act together in\\ndefence of our very humanity. Let it never be asked of\\nany one of us what we did when we knew that\\nanother was oppressed.”\\nMankind should learn to act against all tyranny in a\\nunified manner through the United Nations. This should be\\nour basic aim for the future.\\nSouth Africa also wishes to call attention to the\\nactivities of mercenaries, irrespective of their origin and\\nobjectives. Their destabilizing activities cannot be tolerated.\\nWe call on the international community and the United\\nNations to be seized of this problem of mercenaries.\\nThe women of South Africa have lived, in varying\\ndegrees, under three forms of oppression, relating to race,\\nto class and to gender. One of the first steps towards\\ninitiating positive change in the lives of all South African\\nwomen was the entrenchment of gender rights in our Bill\\nof Rights. It was with much pride that the South African\\ndelegation took their seats at the Fourth World Conference\\non Women, in Beijing. That was the first time South Africa\\nparticipated in a conference on women which focused on\\nthe eradication of poverty, and equal access to education\\nand to health services. South Africa is fully committed to\\nimplementing the Platform for Action adopted at that\\nConference, which will serve as the impetus for a world of\\nequality, development and peace for all. In addition, our\\nParliament has most recently approved South Africa’s\\nratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All\\nForms of Discrimination against Women, without any\\nreservations.\\nYears of apartheid rule have bequeathed the\\noverwhelming majority black population with a heavy\\nlegacy of poverty, social disintegration and political\\ncleavages based on colour and ethnic animosities. It\\ntherefore became the priority task of the South African\\nGovernment of National Unity to devise a national strategy\\nto address this catastrophic situation. A comprehensive and\\nmulti-pronged developmental strategy known as the\\nReconstruction and Development Programme is now being\\nimplemented. The implementation of this Programme relies\\nprimarily on the mobilization of domestic resources through\\nprioritization of budgetary resources, with a view to\\naddressing the huge material inequalities in such areas as\\neducation, health, housing, infrastructure development and\\nland reform. It is a unique people-centred and people-\\ndriven Programme, which seeks to translate into economic\\nbenefit the political miracle in our country. At the very\\nheart of this Programme is the acknowledgement of the\\ninextricable interdependence between the need for\\ntransparent, accountable and democratic governance of\\nour society and the imperative of dynamic economic\\ngrowth and sustainable development.\\nSouth Africa will host the ninth United Nations\\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD IX)\\nfrom 26 April to 11 May 1996. This is an event which all\\nSouth Africans are looking forward to with great\\nexpectation. Indeed, it is my pleasure to announce that\\nour preparations are well advanced and on course.\\nWe attach great significance to UNCTAD IX for a\\nnumber of reasons. We believe that the rapid progress of\\nglobalization and liberalization of the world economy has\\nunderscored the relevance and importance of UNCTAD\\nas a United Nations institution with a strong development\\nmandate and perspective. We also believe that the\\nsuccessful completion of the Uruguay Round of\\nnegotiations and the resultant creation of the World Trade\\nOrganization not only has stressed the validity and\\nrelevance of UNCTAD, but has also reinforced the need\\nto retain and strengthen UNCTAD’s mandate as a policy-\\noriented global intergovernmental forum on trade and\\ndevelopment issues. It is a forum where a strong\\npartnership for development between the developed and\\nthe developing countries can, and must, be forged. While\\nthere may be a need to streamline certain UNCTAD\\nactivities, this should not lead to its demise. Without\\nUNCTAD, our world, especially the developing world,\\nwould be the poorer.\\nI would like to take this opportunity to express my\\nGovernment’s satisfaction with the intergovernmental\\nprocess at the United Nations to draw up a United\\nNations Agenda for Development. We believe that the\\nUnited Nations is the appropriate forum for the\\nelaboration of the Agenda for Development. The Agenda\\nfor Development could open great possibilities for\\ndevelopment and for partnership between the developed\\nand the developing countries. It is for this reason that\\nSouth Africa is taking great interest in the work of the Ad\\nHoc Open-ended Working Group of the General\\nAssembly on an Agenda for Development.\\nMy Government has been following with great\\ninterest the ongoing High-level Intergovernmental\\nMeeting on the Mid-term Global Review of the\\n4\\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\\nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the Least\\nDeveloped Countries. In this connection, I join others in\\ncalling on the international community to devise a global\\nstrategy to effectively address the debt question confronting\\nthe least developed countries, and to use innovative\\nmeasures — whether it be official development aid, foreign\\ndirect investment or multilateral financial assistance — to\\narrest the decline of resources destined for the least\\ndeveloped countries.\\nI would also like to call upon the international\\ncommunity to vigorously pursue measures required to\\nsuccessfully implement the United Nations New Agenda for\\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s. We are pleased in\\nthat regard by the progress registered during the Economic\\nand Social Council’s session in Geneva, especially the high-\\nlevel segment, which was devoted to the aforementioned\\nAgenda. Of course, the challenge before the international\\ncommunity is to find adequate resources to translate this\\nAgenda into tangible results. It is our hope that this issue\\nwill be treated with the required urgency, given that next\\nyear there will be a mid-term global review of the New\\nAgenda for the Development of Africa.\\nRecognizing the importance of cooperation between\\ndeveloping States, South Africa has acceded to an\\nagreement establishing the South Centre. The South Centre\\nwill effectively operate as a policy research unit for the\\nNon-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77, and will draft\\npolicy-oriented position papers on issues of critical\\nimportance to the South. It will, in addition to this basic\\nfunction, generate ideas and proposals for consideration by\\nGovernments of the South and other institutions.\\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and\\nDevelopment engendered a process of environmental action\\nand awareness centred on the relationship between\\neconomic development and the sustainable management of\\nthe environment. It is our duty to carry this process forward\\nin an integrated manner and reconfirm our commitment to\\nthe implementation of international agreements which seek\\nto manage and preserve the world’s environment.\\nSouth Africa is very conscious that the capacity of\\ndeveloping countries to implement sustainable\\nenvironmental strategies will have to be strengthened. The\\nresources pledged towards the attainment of goals set out in\\nAgenda 21 will have to be made available if we are to\\nsucceed in achieving the imperatives of development,\\nsustainable use of the environment, and democracy in the\\nworld.\\nIn Africa, in particular, the ravages of drought and\\nthe advances of desertification require urgent attention.\\nThe global community’s concern for the environment\\nshould be reflected in a common approach to the\\nmanifold environmental pressures threatening our global\\nheritage.\\nThe United Nations also has an important role to\\nplay in assisting States threatened by natural or man-made\\ndisasters. Preventive diplomacy can contribute towards\\neliminating man-made disasters. However, the results of\\nboth man-made disasters and natural disasters can be\\nameliorated by effective international humanitarian\\nassistance coordination through the United Nations. This\\nwill naturally require more coherent programmed delivery\\nand coordination by the Office of the United Nations\\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Food\\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\\n(FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the\\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United\\nNations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) and\\nother international institutions. The United Nations will\\nhave to ensure that the necessary capacities and\\nmechanisms are created. Recent international action,\\nespecially the follow-up to the Tokyo Conference, has\\ndemonstrated that sufficient international will exists to\\nperform this function.\\nWe welcome the adoption on 14 September 1995 of\\nGeneral Assembly resolution 49/252, on the strengthening\\nof the United Nations. I wish to assure the Assembly of\\nour intention to work constructively with the President in\\nthis endeavour.\\nThe world in which we find ourselves today is\\ngreatly changed from just 10 years ago. The cold war has\\nended, the scourge of apartheid has been removed from\\nour common society and peace has come to Mozambique\\nand now Angola. We have also seen the membership of\\nour United Nations increase to 185, a substantial increase\\nsince the time the Security Council’s membership was last\\nincreased. As a result of these, and other, factors the\\ninternational community faces a window of opportunity\\nwithin which the Security Council can be successfully\\nrestructured and reformed.\\nWithin the overall effort to reform the United\\nNations, South Africa believes that the structure and\\nfunctioning of the Security Council should be reformed to\\nmake it more representative, democratic and transparent.\\nThe product of these efforts must be a Security Council\\nthat is effective and legitimate, and that reflects the\\n5\\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\\nrealities of our modern world. This result can be achieved\\nonly if reform and restructuring is dealt with as a package.\\nOne of the products of this reform process must result in\\nAfrica having equitable representation on any enlarged\\nSecurity Council.\\nIt would be appropriate for me to conclude by\\nreferring to the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\\nThe people of South Africa will celebrate this fiftieth\\nanniversary in concert with the rest of the world. Our\\nNational Committee organizing the events in our country\\nhas adopted the following as its Declaration of Intent:\\n“To create an awareness among the peoples of South\\nAfrica of the role which the United nations can play\\nin their daily lives, and to assist the United Nations in\\nresponding to the challenges of the twenty-first\\ncentury.”\\nPresident Mandela looks forward to joining his fellow\\nworld leaders in a few weeks’ time to celebrate the\\nvisionary step taken half a century ago towards the creation\\nof a better world. Building on the successes and victories\\nof the past, we now embrace the future. We can face the\\nchallenges ahead, inspired by a vision of a new world\\nwhere peace and respect for human dignity are the standard.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n","2328  ﻿Allow me, Sir, on behalf of the Government of Greece, to congratulate you on your election as President of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. You represent a country with which Greece maintains ties of sincere friendship. Your extensive experience in international affairs and the abilities which have distinguished you as a successful diplomat give us the certainty that the work of this session will be brought to a successful conclusion. I should also like to avail myself of the opportunity to express to your predecessor, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhuty, our appreciation of the able manner and the effectiveness with which he guided the work of the forty-first session of the General Assembly.\\nI should like, further, to pay tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the dedication with which he devotes his services to the safeguarding of peace, in accordance with the decisions of the United Nations.\\nThe Foreign Minister of Denmark, Mr. Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, as President of the European Community, has already presented the positions of its 12 member States on the main issues confronting us today. These positions, with which we fully concur, reflect the international activities and responsibilities of the Community , as well as the common policies developed by its member States aimed at the promotion of stability and co-operation in international relations.\\nI shall therefore limit myself to certain major issues of particular interest to Greece. The promotion of disarmament and out efforts to consolidate security constitute fundamental objectives of my Government's policy. Within the framework of that policy, which we have pursued with consistency, we have promoted a number of initiatives at the national, regional and international level. The Prime Minister of Greece, together with the leaders of the other countries participating in the well-known initiative of the Six, are continuing their untiring efforts towards nuclear disarmament.\\nThe momentous developments of recent days are a source of great satisfaction and of hope for the future. The agreement reached in principle between the United States and the Soviet Union for the elimination of Intermediate-range nuclear weapons constitutes a big step towards the banning of all nuclear weapons. We congratulate the leaders of the two super-Powers, President Ronald Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. The success of these negotiations gives us grounds for hoping that the relations between East and West will continue to improve. At the same time, we express the hope that an agreement on the reduction of strategic weapons by 50 per cent will become a reality, as will the complete cessation o ť all nuclear tests. However, we are also concerned at the continuing rapid increase m conventional armaments. The existing imbalances constitute a serious threat to international peace. We are convinced that, given the necessary good will, it is possible to reach viable agreements regarding balanced reductions of such armaments and an effective system of verification.\\nI would be remiss if I did not repeat at this point, as I did last year, our apprehension regarding the continuing spread and use of chemical weapons, which constitute a flagrant violation of existing international rules and agreements, we are convinced that one of the aims of the international community should be a complete ban on the production and use of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles.\\nThe reduction of all types of armaments is an imperative necessity in a world with limited natural and financial resources. While hundreds of millions of people on our planet are suffering from extreme poverty and are not in a position to develop their economies, the spending of vast amounts on armaments constitutes blatant provocation. That is why we attach particular importance to the result of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development. The adoption by consensus of its Final Document is an encouraging indication of the international community's political will to face the problems of developing countries through substantial progress in disarmament.\\nMy country, consistent with its policy of promoting peace and detente, has always supported the efforts of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe as a means of maintaining a constructive dialogue between East and West. We have every reason to hope that substantial progress will be achieved during the fourth phase of the Vienna meeting which has just begun. It is fortunate that this meeting comes at a time of encouraging activity in the field of conventional disarmament and of the agreement reached in principle between the two super-Powers on the elimination of the intermediate-range missiles from Europe. The circumstances in which the Vienna meeting is taking place are unique, and we should exploit them as a first-rate opportunity for the maintenance of security and the promotion of co-operation in Europe.\\nI should like to stress at this point that a condition for the maintenance of security and the promotion of co-operation in Europe and the improvement of the political climate in that region is the creation of a feeling of confidence. Specifically, the promotion of confidence at the regional level is an imperative need. My Government is proud that after continuous efforts it was able to develop the closest possible relations with most of Greece's neighbours. The Balkans, in the past the powder-keg of Europe, are today a model of regional co-operation between countries with different political and economic systems. I wish also to underline the consistency and firmness with which my Government supports the proposal to make the Balkans a zone free from nuclear and chemical weapons.\\nAnother area on which the attention of my Government is particularly focused is that of the Mediterranean, as it is related directly to the security of Greece. We have repeatedly stated that the Mediterranean should become a sea of peace, friendship and co-operation among its peoples. We have sincerely supported all efforts to that end.\\nWe deal with international problems and examine them simply from the viewpoint of the countries involved while tending to ignore the fact that, in the final analysis, it is the individual who is the victim of international conflicts. When some countries spend enormous amounts on armaments, instead of directing them to development projects necessary to improve the living standards of their people, in the end it is the individual who suffers. If countries that have blatantly violated and disregarded decisions of the United Nations persist in policies which have been condemned, again it is the individual who suffers.\\nMy Government is deeply concerned over the question of the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as the promotion of social, economic and cultural rights. The problem transcends regional relationships. It is a problem with international repercussions. We are particularly satisfied to see that the United Nations is continuing its efforts in this field and that it has not been discouraged by the many obstacles it has encountered and by the flagrant violations of human rights.\\nIt is our conviction that all States are bound to comply strictly with their international obligations deriving from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the relevant international instruments subsequently adopted. Compliance with these obligations is a duty, not an option. As far as we are concerned, we have always unequivocally condemned every violation of human rights, regardless of where and by whom it is committed. The Greek Government has taken an unreserved position in favour of the equality of the two sexes. It has actively participated in all regional and international efforts to ensure the complete elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. At the national level we have adopted policies in favour of a status of women equal to that of men, in all fields of economic, social and cultural life. Within the United Nations we actively support the strengthening of and an increase in the activities of the committees dealing with women's issues.\\nThe problem of international terrorism, although it has been less acute in recent months, is still a destabilizing factor in international relations. My country has severely suffered because of terrorism. My Government has repeatedly condemned and continues to condemn every terrorist act  regardless of its origin. The present session of the General Assembly will deal with this subject. We hope that it will be possible, with the co-operation of all States, to reach positive and substantive results and that the consensus reached during the fortieth session will be maintained.\\nYear after year the United Nations deals with a number of major international issues. These issues still appear on the agenda, which shows how little progress we have made towards their solution. However, there have been some encouraging developments.\\nWe welcome the recent initiative of the Heads of State of the five Central American countries which led to an agreement for the implementation of a peace plan in the area. We consider this to be a notable achievement by five small countries which have decided to take their fate into their own hands and establish the forms of co-operation for their own region. My Government is convinced that the countries in Central America cam peacefully resolve their problems without foreign intervention. We attach particular importance to the application of democratic procedures and to respect for human and civil rights, and we believe that proposals made for a unilateral cessation of hostilities can be of assistance in this respect. I believe that all countries should respond positively to the appeal made from this rostrum to ensure the success of the peace plan in Central America.\\nMy country, as is well known, attaches particular importance to developments in the Middle East, an area where not only peace in the region but also international stability and security are in danger. The Arab-Israeli conflict remains unresolved, as there has been no change in the situation created by the use of force, the occupation of Arab territories since 1967 by Israel and the lack of a substantive and comprehensive peace process. The fact that the idea of an international conference, which my country has supported for a long time, seems to be gaining ground, even among those that until recently categorically rejected it, gives us ground for hope. Greece has from the outset supported the idea of convening an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations for the solution of the Middle East problem in which all the directly interested parties would participate. Recent decisions of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the European Community present a satisfactory framework for starting an effective peace process.\\nWe believe, furthermore, that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) should participate in the conference and that the modalities of its participation concern the Arab countries and, in particular, the Palestinians themselves. This conference should have a substantive role, not be converted into a ceremonial forum. It is obvious that the modalities of the conference should be decided by the interested parties themselves, including the PLO, which is the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. We hope that the last obstacles impeding the convening of a conference may soon be overcome.\\nWe have repeatedly stressed that the basic pre-condition of a peace settlement in the Middle East is the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied Arab territories. We support the aspirations of the Palestinian people to exercise the fundamental, Inalienable right to self-determination, including the eight to create their own State.\\nAt the same time, it is well known that we support the right of Israel to exist as a State within internationally recognized and secure borders. However, Israel should not deny to the Palestinian people what it rightly seeks for itself - namely, the right to exist. Nor can the international community tolerate the illegal policy of the imposition of arbitrary measures, the establishment of settlements and the creation of fait accompli in the occupied territories. Such a policy, as in the case of Cyprus, is aimed at altering the legal status of the territories in question and their geographic, natural and demographic conditions, and distorting their history and the identity of their inhabitants.\\nThe tragic situation in Lebanon continues unabated despite some occasional faint hopes of a peace settlement, which unfortunately quickly fade. My country again calls upon the interested parties and those exercising influence to work peacefully to preserve the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Lebanon and eliminate violence.\\nThe war between Iran and Iraq also continues unabated despite the appeals and efforts of the international community. We have also recently witnessed an increase in tension in the vital area of the Gulf.\\nThe tragedy of that war, which entails enormous costs to the two peoples involved, and the magnitude of the dangers created by the ever increasing escalation of tension in the Gulf make it imperative that hostilities cease and peace talks begin, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, including resolution 598 (1987). We appreciate the devotion and courage which the Secretary-General displayed in discharging his duties during his mission, for the purpose of securing respect for and full implementation of those resolutions.\\nI also wish to stress the importance that my Government attaches to safeguarding free and secure navigation in the area. I must insist upon this point because, unfortunately, my country has suffered from indiscriminate attacks upon Greek merchant vessels, which have caused enormous material damage and the loss of innocent lives.\\nThe situation in southern Africa continues, regrettably, to endanger peace, security and stability. Greece is watching developments in the area with particular interest. The number of victims of apartheid Increases daily. The extension of the state of emergency and the continuous violations of human rights - in particular, detention of religious and trade union leaders, detention of children, torture and forced resettlement of the black population and strict press censorship - are developments that deeply preoccupy my Government.\\nThe Greek Government has repeatedly and unequivocally condemned the abhorrent system of apartheid and its inherent violence. We call upon the Government of South Africa to engage in a national dialogue with the genuine representatives of the majority of the population, which should lead to the complete eradication of apartheid and the establishment by peaceful means of a democratic, non-racial and United South Africa.\\nWe strongly condemn South Africa's repeated aggressive and destabilizing activities against the sovereignty, Independence and territorial integrity of neighbouring States. Greece affirms its solidarity with the front-line States, which should receive full International support in order to cope successfully with the threat against them. In 1986 a highly significant meeting took place in Lusaka between representatives of the European Community and the front-line States. I attended that meeting and remain convinced of its usefulness. I hope that those efforts will continue.\\nWe also strongly condemn the continuation of the illegal occupation by South Africa of Namibia, whose people are being denied the right to exercise the fundamental right to self-determination and independence. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) constitutes the sole internationally accepted basis for the peaceful solution of the problem. The Greek Government categorically rejects any linkage of the Implementation of resolution 435 (1978) with extraneous issues, as well as delaying tactics used for this purpose. We consider the establishment In Namibia of the so-called interim administration to be null and void.\\nThe Greek Government expresses its concern with regard to the dangerous situation prevailing in two areas of Asia: Afghanistan and Kampuchea. It is regrettable that diplomatic efforts towards their solution have not yet produced the hoped-for results. We are consistent in condemning all cases of invasion and occupation as well as every effort to create fait accompli. We therefore believe that unless all foreign troops in Afghanistan and Kampuchea are withdrawn as soon as possible in accordance with United Nations resolutions no viable solution can be reached. It is imperative that the bloodshed and suffering of the people of these two countries be brought to an end.\\nWith regard to the situation in the Korean peninsula, we hope that a just and peaceful solution will be found, to the benefit of the entire Korean people, in accordance with the generally accepted principles of international law. We believe that the promotion of confidence-building measures in the Korean peninsula will create the appropriate conditions for the Olympic Games of 1988 to take place in an atmosphere of co-operation rather than confrontation.\\nThe international economic situation shows signs of stress. Imbalances remain, growth rates are low and the future is uncertain. The resumption of high and stable growth rates must be secured in order to bring about solutions to the debt problems of the developing countries and an improvement in the market conditions for their primary commodities.\\nThe third world's external debt crisis must be resolved through dialogue and greater understanding of the problem by the international community. We should not lose sight of the political dimension of this problem. The people of the over—indebted countries shouldering the unbearable burden of external debt are deprived of a dignified standard of living. As a result, phenomena of social turmoil have surfaced. The low prices of primary commodities have severely curtailed the exchange earnings of a large number of developing countries. Those countries face serious difficulties in servicing their external debt while implementing strict stabilization programmes, unfortunately, development assistance to those countries and flows of new capital from the international financial system have not yet reached the levels necessary to permit successful implementation of their stabilization policies. For that reason development efforts have fallen behind.\\nThe final text adopted by the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) provides a framework for remedial solutions. At the same time imaginative and courageous solutions should be pursued In international forums, particularly at the International Monetary Fund, whose annual meetings begin today.\\nI should like to elaborate on an issue of particular concern to the Greek nation that in recent years has been repeatedly dealt with by the United Nations. I am referring to the problem of Cyprus, prolongation of which entails a serious threat to peace and security, not only in the immediate vicinity but also in the broader area of the eastern Mediterranean.\\nMore than 13 years have passed since the Turkish array, in flagrant violation of the basic principles of international law, invaded Cyprus and occupied a large part of the territory of the Republic. After the invasion Ankara attempted as a first step to stabilize its military occupation and to drive out those remaining Greek Cypriots who had not yet fled, to become refugees in their own country, the Invading Turkish army. Subsequently, Ankara attempted to alter the demographic composition of the population through a massive influx of settlers, which it organized politically in order to support an illegal government whose existence depends on the equally illegal presence of the army of occupation. Furthermore, by destroying the cultural heritage of northern Cyprus, by plundering churches and by changing place-names, it is attempting to impose partition and create two separate states in an effort to avert the unity of Cyprus.\\nFor 13 years Turkey has systematically avoided any discussion of those subjects which, by definition, are pre-eminent; namely, withdrawal of the occupation array; agreement on a system of guarantees that would preclude the presentation of pretexts such as those Ankara has raised to justify its invasion; and withdrawal of the settlers and application of elementary human rights concerning freedom of movement, freedom of settlement and the right to property.\\nAnkara has refused to discuss those questions, which obviously should occupy a central position in the consultations. On the contrary, through repeated statements made by Turkey or the Turkish Cypriot leadership, Ankara has made it clear that it has no intention of withdrawing its military forces from the territory of Cyprus, which it is systematically reinforcing with new modern tanks as well as through increasing military personnel. The recent report of the United Nations Secretary-General to the Security Council gives an extremely clear picture of the situation in the area and points out a number of other Turkish and Turkish Cypriot activities that aim solely at the consolidation of the illegal occupation.\\nThe Government of the Republic of Cyprus, in an attempt to help the Secretary-General in his mission of good offices, has proposed alternative procedures aiming at the examination of the aforementioned major issues, that is, either at a high-level meeting or at an international conference. The Greek Government fully supports the position of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus that, before any further discussion on other issues that have already been dealt with, the major issues should be examined - namely, withdrawal of the occupation forces and of the settlers, a new system of enlarged international guarantees precluding the possibility of unilateral intervention and the three freedoms.\\nIt should in particular be stressed that up to now Turkey has refused any discussion of those issues. That attitude is a clear indication of its ultimate aims. It wants to entrap the Government of the Republic of Cyprus into accepting a constitutional system that would serve Turkish interests solely and make no provision for the withdrawal of the occupation army or the settlers or for the restoration of the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus. However, the position of Ankara is highly provocative when it argues that a discussion of the critical problem of Cyprus at this session constitutes a manifestation of intransigence. Indeed, I am astonished at that argument, which expresses a deeper contempt for the United Nations and for the inalienable right of every sovereign Member State to have recourse to the Organization in every case of violation of the principles of the Charter and of the resolutions of United Nations organs.\\nConfronted with this situation we have to decide where our duty lies. It would be distressing and dangerous were we to limit ourselves to the expression of hopes and to regrets over lack of progress. I believe it is time for all of us to face up to our responsibilities and to make it crystal clear that force cannot be accepted as a way of resolving international problems,\\nGreece is convinced that a just and viable solution to the Cyprus question should be sought within the framework of the United Nations and, more specifically/ through the implementation of the numerous General Assembly and Security Council resolutions, which clearly and unequivocally provide for ways to resolve all these major Issues, it is only natural that we look to the United Nations for a just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem. An injustice committed in any part of the world is an injustice against mankind. It is therefore the duty of mankind to restore justice.\\n   \n","4546  On behalf of the\\ndelegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia, I am\\nparticularly pleased to extend, through you, Mr. Acting\\nPresident, my warmest congratulations on the occasion\\nof the election of Mr. Harri Holkeri as President of the\\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly of the\\nUnited Nations. May I also convey my congratulations\\nto Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, President of the fifty-fourth\\nsession, for his eminent leadership and successful\\nsteering of the work of that session. Equal\\ncongratulations go to Secretary-General Kofi Annan\\nfor his admirable and untiring efforts made on behalf of\\npeace and development in the world. I would also like\\nto take this opportunity to welcome Tuvalu into the\\nOrganization and to convey the sincere congratulations\\nof the Cambodian delegation. Tuvalu's presence among\\nus will add a new credit to our Organization.\\nThe political platform for economic development,\\nlaunched by the Royal Government of Cambodia since\\nits formation in 1998, after many decades of civil war\\nand tragedy, and in spite of enormous difficulties and\\nobstacles, has scored good results with regular growth,\\nthus paving the way for a solid foundation for long-\\nterm economic growth and sustainable development in\\nCambodia.\\nThe achievements of 1999, and of the first six\\nmonths of this year, are encouraging for the future of\\nCambodia. The Kingdom of Cambodia, with its\\nprofound belief that the value of democracy and human\\nrights should be in harmony with cultural peculiarities,\\ntraditions, and level of development, considers human\\nrights to be one of the foundations of the system of\\ngovernment. The Royal Government of Cambodia, at\\npresent, is making great efforts towards the\\nreinforcement of democratic pluralism and the rule of\\nlaw.\\nThe recently held Millennium Summit on the role\\nof the United Nations in the twenty-first century has,\\nthrough its Millennium Declaration, defined great\\nguidelines on this universal institution's policies and\\nreforms, designed to overcome problems facing our\\nplanet in the third millennium. The shared reflection of\\nour leaders is testimony to the aspirations of all peoples\\nthroughout the world for a more equitable international\\nenvironment in the face of rapid globalization and its\\neffects on the economic, social and cultural\\ndevelopment of all nations.\\nOn the question of the Security Council, the\\nRoyal Government of Cambodia believes, as do many\\nMember States, that it is very important for the\\nSecurity Council to reflect the reality of today's world.\\nThis can be achieved by expanding the permanent and\\nnon-permanent membership of the Council to the\\ndeveloping countries and to those countries that have\\nconcretely contributed to sharing the burden of United\\nNations operations. Only through overall reform and\\nenlargement will the Security Council be able to\\nmaintain its effectiveness and legitimacy in this new\\nmillennium. In this regard, Cambodia strongly supports\\nJapan's and India's permanent membership in this core\\nbody of the United Nations.\\nThe Kingdom of Cambodia observes with great\\ninterest the situation in the Middle East. We urge both\\nsides to make greater efforts in order to achieve lasting\\npeace in this suffering region. The Kingdom of\\nCambodia reaffirms its total support for a fair,\\nequitable, durable, and global settlement based on the\\nrelevant resolutions of the United Nations and on the\\napplication of the agreed-upon peace accords, so that\\nthe inalienable rights of the Palestinian people will be\\nrecognized by all.\\nIn spite of the consequences of the financial crisis\\nin 1997 and 1998, Asia is on the road to recovery and\\nAsia's economic growth has ever since been recorded.\\nThe thirty-third Association of Southeast Asian\\nNations (ASEAN) Ministerial Meeting held this past\\nJuly in Bangkok bears witness once more to the\\nexemplary solidarity between member States to\\nintegrate their economies and to further advance their\\nmultiform cooperation.\\nThe Kingdom of Cambodia is very pleased with\\nthe inter-Korean summit meeting in Pyongyang last\\nJune, which we consider as an important landmark in\\nthe relationship between the two brotherly nations, and\\nwhich has enormously contributed to the maintenance\\nof peace and stability in its region as well as in the\\nwhole world and to the peaceful reunification of Korea.\\n(spoke in French)\\n25\\n\\nWe are witnessing, today, the growing\\nphenomenon of globalization. There are no States that\\ncan avoid its immense impact on our daily life.\\nHowever, the process of globalization is not a\\nsufficient answer to the quest of the developing\\ncountries to reach progress and development for better\\nliving conditions of their people. It is clear that the\\nimpact of globalization benefits, primarily, States\\nhaving strong economies and advanced technology,\\nwhile leaving the least developed countries with little,\\nif any, means to cope with such reality.\\nThe developing countries, especially the least\\ndeveloped countries, that cannot catch up with\\nglobalization's speed will be left behind. The rich\\ncountries will get richer and more developed, and the\\npoor countries will get poorer and poorer.\\nTherefore, the Royal Government of Cambodia\\ncalls all Member States of the United Nations to unite\\ntheir efforts and resources to make sure that the\\nbenefits of globalization are expanded more equally\\namong the international community and to maximize\\nthe positive impact of this phenomenon in order to\\nenable the least developed countries to follow the trend\\nof globalization.\\nAnother aspect of finance for development is the\\ncrushing burden of debt that weighs on the developing\\ncountries. Debt places a heavy burden on the\\ndevelopment process of many developing countries.\\nUnfortunately, the debt strategies that have been\\nimplemented so far have not proved capable of solving\\nthis problem.\\nThe Royal Government of Cambodia appreciates\\nthe initiative taken by some nations in agreeing to\\nsolve the intolerable debt burden of the least developed\\ncountries. However, the results are currently far from\\nbeing sufficient. That is why we appeal for these\\ninitiatives to be adopted by some other members of the\\ninternational community, enabling more poor countries\\nto benefit from these human and just actions.\\nCambodia sincerely hopes that the Millennium\\nSummit, which has just successfully concluded, will\\nbring about the imperative reform of the United\\nNations. The reform of this important world body will\\npositively respond to the reality of the world today, and\\nwould be able, I hope, to establish a new mechanism to\\nsave the developing countries from becoming victims\\nof globalization, even as other countries derive greater\\nand greater benefit.\\nIn this context, as the United Nations has been\\ncalled upon by the Millennium Summit to play a more\\ndecisive role in ensuring that the development of\\nnations is more equitable, it is necessary that this world\\ninstitution possess the means to support its actions.\\nAlso, it is an imperative requirement to establish a new\\nmechanism of relations between the United Nations\\nand the international financial institution.\\n Moreover, it is necessary to have a new order of\\ninternational relations in view of the rapid phenomenon\\nof globalization, so as to reduce the ever-increasing\\nunjust gap between the rich and poor countries. I am\\nconvinced that this is not a matter of generosity, but a\\nmatter of human security, as well as the security of the\\nentire international community.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n

Out of the ashes of the Second World War, having witnessed the unthinkable power of the atomic age, the United States has worked with many nations in the Assembly to prevent a third world war — by forging alliances with old adversaries; by supporting the steady emergence of strong democracies accountable to their people and not to any foreign Power; and by building an international system that imposes a cost on those who choose conflict over cooperation, an order that recognizes the dignity and equal worth of all people.\n","That has been the work of seven decades. That is the ideal that this body has, at its best, pursued. Of course, there have been too many times when, collectively, we have fallen short of those ideals. Over the seven decades, terrible conflicts have claimed untold victims. But we have pressed forward, slowly, steadily, to make a system of international rules and norms that are better and stronger and more consistent.\n","It is that international order that has underwritten unparalleled advances in human liberty and prosperity. It is that collective endeavour that has brought about diplomatic cooperation among the world’s major Powers and buttressed a global economy that has lifted more than a billion people from poverty. It is those international principles that have helped constrain bigger countries from imposing their will on smaller ones and have advanced the emergence of democracy and development and individual liberty on every continent.\n","That progress is real. It can be documented in lives saved, agreements forged, diseases conquered and mouths fed. And yet we come together today knowing that the march of human progress never travels in a straight line, that our work is far from complete and that dangerous currents risk pulling us back into a darker, more disordered world.\n","Today we are seeing the collapse of strongmen and fragile States breeding conflict and driving innocent men, women and children across borders on an epic scale. Brutal networks of terror have stepped into the vacuum. Technologies that empower individuals are now also exploited by those who spread disinformation, suppress dissent or radicalize our youth. Global capital flows have powered growth and investment, but they have also increased the risk of contagion, weakened the bargaining power of workers and accelerated inequality.\n","How should we respond to those trends? There are those who argue that the ideals enshrined in the Charter of the UN are unachievable or out of date, a legacy of a postwar era not suited to our own. In effect, they are arguing for a return to the rules that applied for most of human history and that predate this institution — the belief that power is a zero-sum game, that might makes right, that strong States must impose their will on weaker ones, that the rights of individuals do not matter and that in a time of rapid change, order must be imposed by force.\n","On that basis, we see some major Powers assert themselves in ways that contravene international law. We see an erosion of the democratic principles and human rights that are fundamental to this institution’s mission. Information is strictly controlled and the space for civil society restricted. We are told that such retrenchment is required to beat back disorder; that it is the only way to stamp out terrorism and prevent foreign meddling. In accordance with that logic, we should support tyrants like Bashar Al-Assad, who drops barrel bombs to massacre innocent children, because the alternative is surely worse.\n","This increasing scepticism of our international order can also be found in the most advanced democracies. We see greater polarization and more frequent gridlock, with movements on the far right, and sometimes the left, that insist on stopping the trade that binds our fates to other nations or calling for the building of walls to keep out immigrants. Most ominously, we see the fears of ordinary people being exploited through appeals to sectarianism, tribalism, racism or anti-Semitism; appeals to a glorious past before the body politic was infected by those who look different or worship God differently — a politics of us versus them.\n","The United States is not immune to this. Even as our economy is growing and our troops have largely returned from Iraq and Afghanistan, we see in our debates about America’s role in the world a notion of strength that is defined by opposition to old enemies, perceived adversaries — a rising China or resurgent Russia, a revolutionary Iran or an Islam that is incompatible with peace. We see arguments that the only strength that matters for the United States is bellicose words and shows of military force, and that cooperation and diplomacy will not work.\n","As President of the United States, I am mindful of the dangers that we face. They cross my desk every \n","morning. I lead the strongest military that the world has ever known, and I will never hesitate to protect my country or our allies, unilaterally and by force where necessary. But I stand before the Assembly today believing in my core that we, the nations of the world, cannot return to the old ways of conflict and coercion. We cannot look backwards. We live in an integrated world, one in which we all have a stake in one another’s success.\n","We cannot turn back those forces of integration. No nation here in the Assembly can insulate itself from the threat of terrorism, the risk of financial contagion, the flow of migrants or the danger of a warming planet. The disorder we see is not driven solely by competition between nations or by any single ideology. If we cannot work together more effectively, we will all suffer the consequences.\n","That is true for the United States as well. No matter how powerful our military, how strong our economy, we understand the United States cannot solve the world’s problems alone. In Iraq, the United States learned the hard lesson that even with hundreds of thousands of brave, effective troops and trillions of dollars from our Treasury, it cannot by itself impose stability on a foreign land. Unless we work with other nations under the mantle of international norms, principles and law that offers legitimacy to our efforts, we will not succeed. And unless we work together to defeat the ideas that drive the various communities in a country like Iraq into conflict, any order that our militaries can impose will be temporary.\n","Just as force alone cannot impose order internationally, I believe in my core that repression cannot forge the social cohesion that nations need to succeed. The history of the last two decades proves that in today’s world, dictatorships are unstable. The strongmen of today become the spark of revolution tomorrow. You can jail your opponents, but you cannot imprison ideas. You can try to control access to information, but you cannot turn a lie into truth. It is not a conspiracy of United States-backed non-governmental organizations that exposes corruption and raises the expectations of people around the globe — it is technology, social media and the irreducible desire of people everywhere to make their own choices about how they are governed.\n","Indeed, I believe that in today’s world, the measure of strength is no longer defined by the control of territory. Lasting prosperity does not come solely from\n","the ability to access and extract raw materials. The strength of nations depends on the success of their people — their knowledge, innovation, imagination, creativity, drive and opportunity — and that, in turn, depends on individual rights, good governance and personal security. Both internal repression and foreign aggression are symptoms of a failure to provide that foundation.\n","Politics and solidarity that depend on demonizing others, that draw on religious sectarianism, narrow tribalism or jingoism, may at times look like strength in the moment, but over time their weakness will be exposed. And history tells us that the dark forces unleashed by this type of politics surely make all of us less secure. Our world has been there before. We gain nothing from going back.\n","Instead, I believe that we must go forward in pursuit of our ideals, not abandon them at this critical time. We must give expression to our best hopes, not our deepest fears. This institution was founded because men and women who came before us had the foresight to know that our nations are more secure when we uphold basic laws and norms and pursue a path of cooperation rather than conflict. And strong nations, above all, have a responsibility to uphold that international order.\n","Let me give a concrete example. After I took office, I made it clear that one of the principal achievements of the UN — the nuclear non-proliferation regime — was endangered by Iran’s violation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. On that basis, the Security Council tightened sanctions on the Iranian Government, and many nations joined us to enforce them. Together, we showed that laws and agreements mean something. But we also understood that the goal of sanctions was not simply to punish Iran. Our objective was to test whether Iran could change course, accept constraints and allow the world to verify that its nuclear programme would be peaceful. For two years, the United States and our partners, including Russia and China, stuck together in complex negotiations. The result is a lasting, comprehensive deal that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon while allowing it to access peaceful energy. If the deal is fully implemented, the prohibition on nuclear weapons is strengthened, a potential war is averted and our world is safer. That is the strength of the international system when it works the way it should.\n","That same fidelity to international order guides our responses to other challenges around the world.\n","Consider Russia’s annexation of Crimea and further aggression in eastern Ukraine. America has few economic interests in Ukraine, and we recognize the deep and complex history between Russia and Ukraine. But we cannot stand by when the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a nation is flagrantly violated. If that happens without consequence in Ukraine, it could happen to any of the nations gathered here today. That is the basis of the sanctions that the United States and our partners impose on Russia. It is not a desire to return to a cold war.\n","Now, within Russia, State-controlled media may describe those events as an example of a resurgent Russia — a view shared, by the way, by a number of United States politicians and commentators who have always been deeply sceptical about Russia and seem to be convinced that a new cold war is in fact upon us. And yet look at the results. The Ukrainian people are more interested than ever in aligning with Europe instead of Russia. Sanctions have led to capital flight, a contracting economy, a fallen rouble and the emigration of more educated Russians.\n","Imagine if, instead, Russia had engaged in true diplomacy and worked with Ukraine and the international community to ensure that its interests were protected. That would be better for Ukraine, but also better for Russia and better for the world, which is why we continue to press for this crisis to be resolved in a way that allows a sovereign and democratic Ukraine to determine its future and control its territory. This is not because we want to isolate Russia — we do not — but because we want a strong Russia that is invested in working with us to strengthen the international system as a whole.\n","Similarly, in the South China Sea, the United States makes no claim on territory there. We do not adjudicate claims. But like every nation gathered here, we have an interest in upholding the basic principles of freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce, and in resolving disputes through international law, not the law of force. So we will defend those principles, while encouraging China and other claimants to resolve their differences peacefully. I say this while recognizing that diplomacy is hard, the outcomes are sometimes unsatisfying and it is rarely politically popular. But I believe that leaders of large nations in particular have an obligation to take those risks, precisely because we are strong enough to protect our interests if and when diplomacy fails.\n","I also believe that to move forward in this new era, we have to be strong enough to acknowledge when what we are doing is not working. For 50 years, the United States pursued a Cuba policy that failed to improve the lives of the Cuban people. We changed that. We continue to have differences with the Cuban Government. We will continue to stand up for human rights. But we address those issues through diplomatic relations, increased commerce and people-to-people ties. As those contacts yield progress, I am confident that our Congress will inevitably lift an embargo that should not be in place any more. Change will not come overnight to Cuba, but I am confident that openness, not coercion, will support the reforms and the better life that the Cuban people deserve, just as I believe that Cuba will find its success if it pursues cooperation with other nations.\n","Now, if it is in the interest of major Powers to uphold international standards, that is even more true for the rest of the community of nations. Look around the world. From Singapore to Colombia to Senegal, the facts show that nations succeed when they pursue an inclusive peace and prosperity within their borders and work cooperatively with countries beyond those borders.\n","That path is now available to a nation such as Iran, which, as of this moment, continues to deploy violent proxies to advance its interests. Those efforts may appear to give it leverage in disputes with its neighbours, but they fuel sectarian conflict that endangers the entire region and isolates Iran from the promise of trade and commerce. The Iranian people have a proud history and are filled with extraordinary potential. But chanting “Death to America” does not create jobs or make Iran more secure. If Iran chooses a different path, that will be good for the security of the region, good for the Iranian people and good for the world.\n","Of course, around the globe, we will continue to be confronted with nations that reject these lessons of history — places where civil strife, border disputes and sectarian wars give rise to terrorist enclaves and humanitarian disasters. Where order has completely broken down, we must act, but we will be stronger when we act together.\n","In such efforts, the United States will always do its part. We will do so mindful of the lessons of the past — not just the lessons of Iraq, but also the example of Libya, where we joined an international coalition\n","under a UN mandate to prevent a slaughter. Even as we helped the Libyan people bring an end to the reign of a tyrant, our coalition could have and should have done more to fill a vacuum left behind. We are grateful to the UN for its efforts to forge a unity Government. We will help any legitimate Libyan Government as it works to bring the country together.\n","We also have to recognize that we must work more effectively in the future, as an international community, to build capacity for States that are in distress before they collapse. That is why we should celebrate the fact that, later today, the United States will join with more than 50 countries to enlist new capabilities — infantry, intelligence, helicopters, hospitals, and tens of thousands of troops — to strengthen UN peacekeeping. These new capabilities can prevent mass killing and ensure that peace agreements are more than words on paper. But we have to do it together. Together, we must strengthen our collective capacity to establish security where order has broken down and to support those who seek a just and lasting peace.\n","Nowhere is our commitment to international order more tested than in Syria. When a dictator slaughters tens of thousands of his own people, that is not just a matter of one nation’s internal affairs. It breeds human suffering on an order of magnitude that affects us all. Likewise, when a terrorist group beheads captives, slaughters the innocent and enslaves women, that is not a single nation’s national security problem. It is an assault on humankind as a whole.\n","I have said before and I will repeat: there is no room to accommodate an apocalyptic cult like the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and the United States makes no apologies for using our military, as part of a broad coalition, to go after them. We do so with a determination to ensure that there will never be a safe haven for terrorists who carry out these crimes. We have demonstrated over more than a decade of relentless pursuit of Al-Qaida that we will not be outlasted by extremists.\n","While military power is necessary, it is not sufficient to resolve the situation in Syria. Lasting stability can take hold only when the people of Syria forge an agreement to live together peacefully. The United States is prepared to work with any nation, including Russia and Iran, to resolve the conflict. But we must recognize that after so much bloodshed, so much carnage, there cannot be a return to the pre-war status quo.\n","Let us remember how this started. Al-Assad reacted to peaceful protests by escalating repression and killing that, in turn, created the environment for the current strife. And so Al-Assad and his allies cannot simply pacify the broad majority of a population that has been brutalized by chemical weapons and indiscriminate bombing. Yes, realism dictates that compromise will be required to end the fighting and, ultimately, stamp out ISIL. But realism also requires a managed transition away from Al-Assad and to a new leader, and an inclusive Government that recognizes there must be an end to this chaos so that the Syrian people can begin to rebuild.\n","We know that ISIL — which emerged out of the chaos of Iraq and Syria — depends on perpetual war to survive, but we also know that they gain adherents because of a poisonous ideology. Part of our job, together, is to work to reject such extremism that infects too many of our young people. Part of that effort must be a continued rejection by Muslims of those who distort Islam to preach intolerance and promote violence. It must also involve a rejection by non-Muslims of the ignorance that equates Islam with terrorism.\n","This work will take time. There are no easy answers to Syria, and there are no simple answers to the changes that are taking place in much of the Middle East and North Africa. But so many families need help right now; they do not have time. That is why the United States is increasing the number of refugees whom we welcome within our borders. That is why we will continue to be the largest donor of assistance to support those refugees. Today we are launching new efforts to ensure that our people and our businesses, our universities and our non-governmental organizations can help as well, because in the faces of suffering families, our nation of immigrants sees itself.\n","Of course, in the old ways of thinking, the plight of the powerless, the plight of refugees, the plight of the marginalized did not matter. They were on the periphery of the world’s concerns. Today, our concern for them is driven not just by conscience, but should also be driven by self-interest. Helping people who have been pushed to the margins of our world is not mere charity; it is a matter of collective security. The purpose of this institution is not merely to avoid conflict; it is to galvanize the collective action that makes life better on this planet.\n","The commitments we have made to the Sustainable Development Goals speak to this truth. I believe that \n","capitalism has been the greatest creator of wealth and opportunity that the world has ever known. But from big cities to rural villages around the world, we also know that prosperity is still cruelly out of reach for too many. As His Holiness Pope Francis reminds us, we are stronger when we value the least among these and see them as equal in dignity to ourselves and our sons and our daughters.\n","We can roll back preventable disease and end the scourge of HIV/AIDS. We can stamp out pandemics that recognize no borders. That work may not be on television right now, but as we demonstrated in reversing the spread of Ebola, it can save more lives than anything else we can do. Together, we can eradicate extreme poverty and erase barriers to opportunity. But this requires a sustained commitment to our people so farmers can feed more people, so entrepreneurs can start a business without paying a bribe, so young people have the skills they need to succeed in this modern, knowledge-based economy.\n","We can promote growth through trade that meets a higher standard, and that is what we are doing through the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a trade agreement that encompasses nearly 40 per cent of the global economy, an agreement that will open markets while protecting the rights of workers and protecting the environment that enables development to be sustained.\n","We can roll back the pollution that we put in our skies and help economies lift people out of poverty without condemning our children to the ravages of an ever-warming climate. The same ingenuity that produced the Industrial Age and the Computer Age allows us to harness the potential of clean energy. No country can escape the ravages of climate change. And there is no stronger sign of leadership than putting future generations first. The United States will work with every nation that is willing to do its part so that we can come together in Paris to decisively confront this challenge.\n","Finally, regarding our vision for the future of the Assembly, my belief in moving forward rather than backwards requires us to defend the democratic principles that allow societies to succeed. Let me start from a simple premise. Catastrophes like what we are seeing in Syria do not take place in countries where there is genuine democracy and respect for the universal values this institution is supposed to defend.\n","I recognize that democracy is going to take different forms in different parts of the world. The very idea of a people governing themselves depends upon government giving expression to their unique culture, their unique history, their unique experiences. But some universal truths are self-evident. No person wants to be imprisoned for peaceful worship. No woman should ever be abused with impunity, no girl should be barred from attending school. There should be freedom to peacefully petition those in power without fear of arbitrary laws. These are not ideas of one country or one culture. They are fundamental to human progress. They are a cornerstone of this institution.\n","I realize that in many parts of the world there is a different view — a belief that strong leadership must tolerate no dissent. I hear it not only from America’s adversaries, but — privately, at least — I also hear it from some of our friends. I disagree. I believe a Government that suppresses peaceful dissent is not showing strength. It is showing weakness and it is showing fear.\n","History shows that regimes that fear their own people will eventually crumble, but strong institutions built on the consent of the governed endure long after any one individual is gone. That is why our strongest leaders, from George Washington to Nelson Mandela, have elevated the importance of building strong, democratic institutions over a thirst for perpetual power. Leaders who amend constitutions to stay in office only acknowledge that they failed to build a successful country for their people, because none of us lasts forever. It tells us that power is something they cling to for its own sake rather than for the betterment of those whom they purport to serve.\n","I understand that democracy is frustrating. Democracy in the United States is certainly imperfect. At times it can be dysfunctional. But democracy — the constant struggle to extend rights to more of our people, to give more people a voice — is what allowed us to become the most powerful nation in the world. It is not simply a matter of principle; it is not an abstraction. Democracy, inclusive democracy, makes countries stronger. When opposition parties can seek power peacefully through the ballot, a country draws upon new ideas. When a free media can inform the public, corruption and abuse are exposed and can be rooted out. When civil society thrives, communities can solve problems that Governments cannot necessarily solve alone. When immigrants are welcomed, countries are \n","more productive and more vibrant. When girls can go to school, get a job and pursue unlimited opportunities, that is when a country realizes its full potential.\n","That is what I believe is America’s greatest strength. Not everybody in America agrees with me. That is part of democracy. I believe that the fact that one can walk the streets of this city right now and pass churches and synagogues and temples and mosques where people worship freely; the fact that our nation of immigrants mirrors the diversity of the world — one can find people from everywhere here in New York City — the fact that in this country everybody can contribute, everybody can participate no matter who they are or what they look like or whom they love — that is what makes us strong.\n","I believe that what is true for America is true for virtually all mature democracies. That is no accident. We can be proud of our nations without defining ourselves in opposition to some other group. We can be patriotic without demonizing someone else. We can cherish our own identities — our religion, our ethnicity, our traditions — without putting others down. Our systems are premised on the notion that absolute power will corrupt, but that people, ordinary people, are fundamentally good and value family and friendship, faith and the dignity of hard work. And with appropriate checks and balances, Governments can reflect that goodness. I believe that is the future we must seek together — to believe in the dignity of every individual, to believe we can bridge our differences and choose cooperation over conflict. That is not weakness; that is strength. It is a practical necessity in our interconnected world.\n","Our people understand this. Think of the Liberian doctor who went door to door to search for Ebola cases and to tell families what to do if they show symptoms. Think of the Iranian shopkeeper who said after the nuclear deal, “God willing, now we will be able to offer many more goods at better prices”. Think of the Americans who lowered the flag over our embassy in Havana in 1961, the year I was born, and who returned this summer to raise that flag back up. One of those men said of the Cuban people, “We could do things for them, and they could do things for us. We loved them”. For 50 years we ignored that fact. Think of the families leaving everything they have known behind, risking barren deserts and stormy waters just to find shelter, just to save their children. One Syrian refugee who was met in Hamburg with warm greetings and shelter said,\n","“We feel there are still some people who love other people”.\n","The people of our UN are not as different as they have been told. They can be made to fear; they can be taught to hate, but they can also respond to hope. History is littered with the failure of false prophets and fallen empires who believed that might always makes right. That will continue to be the case. We can count on it. But we are called upon to offer a different type of leadership, a leadership strong enough to recognize that nations share common interests and people share a common humanity. And, yes, there are certain ideas and principles that are universal. That is what those who shaped the UN 70 years ago understood.
